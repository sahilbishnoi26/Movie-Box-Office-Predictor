      "\n",
      "Here are various reasons why JUST from looking at this trailer Spoilers ahead if you havent read the book but spoiler tagging anyway\n",
      "\n",
      "1 In the trailer it references several times in which Graff directly tells Ender how he is the chosen one In the book Ender is never directly told why he is accelerated in the program nor why he is treated differently from other students It is only through little bits and pieces from what he gathers using his intellect and what other people tell him example being how he is made a soldier way before his fellow Launchies or how Dink saying no one goes to Command School before 34 years at PreCommand If anything Graff and the other teachers at Battle School do their best to accelerate his development without DIRECTLY intefering or aiding it spoiler\n",
      "\n",
      "2 The point of the school wasnt to groom children to fight buggers in the future because children were some sort of enemy the buggers would never expect The point of Battle School was because Mazer Rackham knew by the time the 3rd Invasion reached the Formic colonies he would still be too old to have the reflexes and mental quickness to handle controlling the fleet And he essentially forced the IF to comply with his wishes after they sent him on relativistic flight because he hijacked his spacecraft and basically said Im not commanding this fleet because I cant so start training people ASAP and find someone who can The sole purpose of the school wasnt to train all these commanders it was to weed out every single child until one who possessed the intellect and knowledge came along Ender isnt the chosen one because Bean was considered to be a very viable backup in case Ender failed spoiler\n",
      "\n",
      "3 This comment concerns the technical aspects of the book to film Although NOT mentioned in Enders Game in Enders Shadow they clearly describe the structure of the Battle School which is several rings I forget how many with only one ring dedicated to students spoiler Adding on to that was that Battle School in the trailer looks to be a very well lit spacious place unlike the book where it is described to be space efficient dark and lit only by the light patterns that guide students to their respective locations based on armies spoiler But this is understandable due to filming issues and not being able to show the sceneactors well Another point is that although not specifically mentioned the Battle Rooms PLURAL were described to be dark and lit only by the stars in the room Not this singular ugly ball of glass that shows space spoiler As for the Battle room guns they werent laser guns that go pew pew like in Star TrekWars Instead they were guns that focused beams of light on your target and had to focus fire for a brief moment in order for the suit to freeze spoiler But again I can understand this point because it wont look cool in the film\n",

      "4 Didnt know New ZealandersMaori spoke with an English accent\n",

      "5 This would be child porn if they actually showed scenes with the kids naked Thus I can completely understand why they chose not to add that point in However if they do ever decide to adapt Enders Shadow probably not considering its much of the same as Enders Game but just from Beans perspective its going to be hard to explain\n",
      "\n",
      "6 Im assuming the end part of the trailer is the simulator at Command School that he uses to control the fleet However in the book it clearly states that Ender doesnt actually control anything He gives commands to his jeesh who then in turn command the actual ships spoiler\n",
      "\n",
      "7 No Giants Game in the trailer Does this mean no Giants Game in the movie dafuq That game alone helped to shape Ender as a person and in turn showed a bit of his personality and is IMMENSELY important in the end of the book which leads towards the rebirth of the Formic race after their xenocide spoiler\n",

      "EDIT It seems the Giants Game will be in the movie\n",

      "So I had to make modifications to the very version of Blender that was used for the production of the original Elephants Dream Since I had several years of experience regarding stereoscopy and stereoscopic renderers it took me only a couple of days to build a versatile and fully animateable stereo renderer into Blenders core rendering and animation system Just to put emphasis on this I did not write a plugin or some scripts this was work done on the inner core of the renderer I did document my progress on that in this short video httpvimeocom14974081\n",
      "\n",
      "Having created that tool I spent some 3 months on carefully adjusting each and every shot Since I always intended to show it in cinemas I changed the aspect from 169 to 185 which of course called for adjustment of the focal length Also for each scene I did stereoscopic direction ie placement of convergence depth and parallax distance faster scenes narrower parallax to reduce strain on the viewer Also many scenes did contain flat 2D matte paintings either in the foreground the background or all inbetween This is where I really had to get artistic For each of those matte paintings I actually 3D modelled what was visible in the matte cut out the respective parts of the matte and applied it as texture A short incomplete list of where I had to do this In the first scene when Emo falls the bridge was a matte in the Elevator scene when Emo and Proog enter the Elevator the cabin is actually a matte however this was a rendered matte and I just had to rerender this so nothing artistic to do here the above ground scene is essentially one big matte and here I really had to to model a lot of boxes\n",

      "\n",
      " And for right now thats all I have There are other bits and pieces here and there Caps shield doesnt harm Ultron the city with blue statues anyone know where that is the mysterious woman in the cave the tampering with Hulks powers the Scarlet Witchs pain in Johannesburg the ballet school almost definitely a part of Widows past the broken Captain America shield Bruce hulking out maybe in a lab Ultron unplugging himself the many MANY civilian deaths and of course the Vision\n",
      "\n",
      " EDIT So Ive been hearing a lot of stuff about Vision possessing an Infinity Gem and I had a thought I was watching a trailer rundown of this most recent trailer and the Soul Gem was brought up And yeah thats definitely a possibility Not just because of the properties of the Soul Gem but more importantly because of HYDRA We already know that Tony and the gang get ahold of the Mind Gem in Lokis staff What if Thor an Asgardian aware of the Infinity Gems informed Tony of the Gems and their power And with the knowledge of the Gems what if Tony somehow found a way to procure the Soul Gem and incorporate it into the Vision Of course this assumes that Tony builds Vision or has a hand in building him In the comics Ultron builds Vision who later turns on him Its possible that in the film Ultron builds Vision the Avengers get ahold of him and Tony modifies him the his own technology AND the Soul Gem in order to create the heroic Vision seen at the end of the trailer Yeah its speculation but it aint bad\n",

      "There were a lot of things we couldnt do in an SR71 but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact People often asked us if because of this fact it was fun to fly the jet Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane Intense maybe Even cerebral But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there at least for a moment  \n",
      "It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months Ripping across the barren deserts 80000 feet below us I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border I was finally after many humbling months of simulators and study ahead of the jet  \n",
      "I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat There he was with no really good view of the incredible sights before us tasked with monitoring four different radios This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital It had been difficult too for me to relinquish control of the radios as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground however Walt was so good at many things but he couldnt match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading He understood that and allowed me that luxury  \n",
      "Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center far below us controlling daily traffic in their sector While they had us on their scope albeit briefly we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace  \n",
      "We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed Center replied November Charlie 175 Im showing you at ninety knots on the ground  \n",
      "Now the thing to understand about Center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna or to Air Force One they always spoke in the exact same calm deep professional tone that made one feel important I referred to it as the  Houston Center voice I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this countrys space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did And it didnt matter what sector of the country we would be flying in it always seemed like the same guy was talking Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere Conversely over the years pilots always wanted to ensure that when transmitting they sounded like Chuck Yeager or at least like John Wayne Better to die than sound bad on the radios  \n",
      "Just moments after the Cessnas inquiry a Twin Beech piped up on frequency in a rather superior tone asking for his ground speed I have you at one hundred and twentyfive knots of ground speed Boy I thought the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren Then out of the blue a navy F18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios Center Dusty 52 ground speed check Before Center could reply Im thinking to myself hey Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that milliondollar cockpit so why is he asking Center for a readout Then I got it ol Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is Hes the fastest dude in the valley today and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet And the reply always with that same calm voice with more distinct alliteration than emotion Dusty 52 Center we have you at 620 on the ground  \n",
      "And I thought to myself is this a ripe situation or what As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios Still I thought it must be done  in mere seconds well be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost That Hornet must die and die now I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming I was torn  \n",
      "Somewhere 13 miles above Arizona there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet Then I heard it The click of the mic button from the back seat That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew Very professionally and with no emotion Walter spoke Los Angeles Center Aspen 20 can you give us a ground speed check There was no hesitation and the replay came as if was an everyday request Aspen 20 I show you at one thousand eight hundred and fortytwo knots across the ground  \n",
      "I think it was the fortytwo knots that I liked the best so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation and you just knew he was smiling But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say in his most fighterpilotlike voice Ah Center much thanks were showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money  \n",
      "For a moment Walter was a god And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice when LAcame back with Roger that Aspen Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours You boys have a good one  \n",
      "It all had lasted for just moments but in that short memorable sprint across the southwest the Navy had been flamed all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed and more importantly Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew A fine days work We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast\n",

      "As a former SR71 pilot and a professional keynote speaker the question Im most often asked is How fast would that SR71 fly I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend Its an interesting question given the aircrafts proclivity for speed but there really isnt one number to give as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to It was common to see 35 miles a minute\n",
      "\n",
      "Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions and never wanted to harm the plane in any way we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed Thus each SR71 pilot had his own individual high speed that he saw at some point on some mission I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way and max power was in order Lets just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadnt previously seen\n",

      "\n",
      "I was flying the SR71 out of RAF Mildenhall England with my backseater Walt Watson we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR71 flypast The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR71 perform a low approach No problem we were happy to do it After a quick aerial refuelling over the North Sea we proceeded to find the small airfield\n",
      "\n",
      "Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat and began to vector me toward the field Descending to subsonic speeds we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze Like most former WWII British airfields the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field but I saw nothing Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze We got a little lower and I pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at With the gear up anything under 275 was just uncomfortable Walt said we were practically over the fieldyet there was nothing in my windscreen I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field Meanwhile below the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the flypast It was a quiet still day with no wind and partial gray overcast Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze I couldnt see it The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle the slower we got With our power back the awaiting cadets heard nothing I must have had good instructors in my flying career as something told me I better crosscheck the gauges As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots my heart stopped and my adrenalinfilled left hand pushed two throttles full forward At this point we werent really flying but were falling in a slight bank Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame and what a joyous feeling that was the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower Shattering the still quiet of that morning they now had 107 feet of firebreathing titanium in their face as the plane levelled and accelerated in full burner on the tower side of the infield closer than expected maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knifeedge pass\n",
      "\n",
      "Quickly reaching the field boundary we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident We didnt say a word for those next 14 minutes After landing our commander greeted us and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings Instead he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR71 flypast he had ever seen especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking He said that some of the cadets hats were blown off and the sight of the plan form of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable Walt and I both understood the concept of breathtaking very well that morning and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach\n",
      "\n",
      "As we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits we just sat therewe hadnt spoken a word since the pass Finally Walter looked at me and said One hundred fiftysix knots What did you see Trying to find my voice I stammered One hundred fiftytwo We sat in silence for a moment Then Walt said Dont ever do that to me again And I never did\n",
      "\n",
      "A year later Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officers club and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR71 flypast that he had seen one day Of course by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows Noticing our HABU patches as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred Walt just shook his head and said It was probably just a routine low approach theyre pretty impressive in that plane Impressive indeed\n",

      "But those happen all the time Gordon Gekko was never meant to be emulated but you better believe he was Scarface was a controversial masterpiece as far as crime dramas go but it was absolutely the glorification of drug and crime culture that helped elevate it to such an iconic status Charles Manson was a monster of the highest order with a lot less going on upstairs than one would initially surmise but there were tons of portrayals of him as a misunderstood genius Breaking Bad was meant to make people despise Walter Whites descent into darkness yet for so many it just tapped into some sort of affable machismo People romanticize Hannibal Lecter all the time Marc Merons character in GLOW was based on an absolute abusive ghoul of a human being who made sure GLOW was only ever a joke because he didnt think female wrestlers really needed to even have an opportunty to know the first thing about the industry Dont even get me started on The Joker and Harley Quinn\n",

      "Hollywood makes what profits and a movie with a bunch of highlyregarded leading ladies in a true crime film that emphasizes style over shoving any palatable message down the viewers throat is what sells People can have a problem with this movie  they will and they should  but it should be no means suddenly be the only movie a normally apolitical viewer decides needs a better message or theres likely some sort of sexist implication there Its Hollywood that means its big dumb fiction\n",

      "If you want a crime film that has a better representation of women Id recommend The Kitchen This looks like a popcorn gangster flick and thats fine Would probably be okay for more people to admit how problematic it really is but the cruelty of the actual events that transpired likely have no bearing on this final product\n",

      "And thats the problem with some of Eastwoods movies Dude is an extremely talented filmmaker and in terms of iconic badasses Id choose him over John Wayne any day of the weekbut he clearly has an agenda that is not fair or accurate to the actual events portrayed\n",
      "\n",
      "Sully was supposed to be an attack on government bureaucrats who  are looking to get the hero discredit him and make it seem like there was no way he couldve done it rather than it being the system that saved the day Sullenberger himself said that it was untrue The NTSB were never that combative they were doing their jobs and they were professionals the same as Sully is But Clint Eastwood has an ideological interest in not portraying the true story like that\n",
      "\n",
      "On the face of it Jewell got roundly done over by the media I was a kid when the Centennial Park event happened but not enough to really remember the details relative to other big events that were happening at the time And it may be that Eastwoods movie sticks completely to the facts and the media was completely embroiled in looking for the lonewolf white man to pin it on\n",
      "\n",
      "However a couple of things are neglected \n",
      "\n",
      "1 its worth asking why this biopic is necessary We know the media fucks up sometimes and in far less circumstances it fucks up royally to the point where it gets people harmed But the media has become an ideological dog whistle where when you consider the creator of the movie is being meant as a standin for malicious PC liberals who are out to get white men Ill wait to see the movie but the trailer depicts Olivia Wildes character as being completely cold and unwavering in the face of factsand I would doubt thats the case in real life\n",
      "\n",
      "In todays climate where the media is constantly under attack being called The Enemy of the People by Trump and where its credibility is being constantly called into question many times for fabricated and conspiratorial reasons this movie will play against that backdrop Its intended to give ammunition to that trope Im almost certain of it\n",
      "\n",
      "2 While I dont remember the details of Centennial Park specifically as a kid I do remember the OKC bombing I also remember Columbine I remember  especially where I was living at the time  that there was a rise in active militia activity and it being in response to government actions in Waco and Ruby Ridge I remember the spike in KKK membership in east and coastal Texas and I remember James Byrd Jr People view the 90s with rosecolored glasses but they were dangerous times as well\n",
      "\n",
      "None of that is an excuse for ruining an innocent mans life and the stress he endured Reading through all of it he deserved all of the settlement he received and more But This didnt happen in a vacuum It wasnt the government and the media on the hunt for a character like that It was an incident that took place in a period of heightened activity by violent white supremacist groups who were looking to harm a lot of people Thats not nothing\n",
      "\n",
      "Clint Eastwoods trailer for this film does not include any of this context and makes it appear that this dudes trials and tribulations took place in a vacuum Id be more convinced of Eastwoods earnestness in government and media overreach if he also did a companion film about any number of Muslims or Sikhs who were harassed by the government and racist rightwingers post911 Hed probably call that PC though rather than it being a credible nuanced view on how the government hivemind will treat certain groups in a period of heightened security threats\n",
      "\n",
      "Its the difference of is Eastwood truly concerned about the government and the media unfairly going after people for imagined crimes of a real event or is he just truly concerned about it when it happens to white men\n",

      "\n",
      "1 Theres a strained relationship between goofball underachieving fantasy gamer and magicbelieving older brother Chris Pratt and nerdy collegeambitious magicskeptic younger brother Tom Holland Pratt is obsessed with adventure shit Holland is mousy academic and is embarrassed by Pratt\n",
      "2 Ironically when it comes to actual magical spells and stuff Tom Holland is better at being magical than Chris Pratt which causes jealousy\n",
      "3 The world while populated with fantasystyle creatures has lost its magic possibly because its suppressed by elements of society This is why they have to disguise Dad and what causes the police chase\n",
      "4 Theres no formal institutions or guidance about how to do anything magicrelated so Pratt assumes his fantasy tabletop gaming stuff will help It does but imperfectly\n",
      "5 For the most part Tom and Chris arent heading towards a destination theyre going back and forth piecing a mystery together\n",
      "6 Father was indeed a wizard His deathdisappearance came about in a dragonrelated incident which caused the fathers wizard staff to get twisted into a tight spiral\n",
      "7 The rural areas theyre traversing are supposed to be offlimits or dangerous\n",
      "8 Octavia Spencers character Manticore the monster at the diner knows mom from the start She undergoes some transformation possibly physical in part into a selfactualized form of her species\n",
      "9 The bikergang fairies are secondary antagonists with their own agenda relating to Pratt and Hollands quest but at least some of them turn into good guys later\n",
      "10 Possible theme about idealized versions of our past disrespecting to reality\n",
      "11 Some kind of message about the virtue of focus and concentration\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Heres some of my logic plus items of note in the trailer one might not pick up on first viewing\n",
      "\n",
      " The wizard in the flashback looks like the father in the photo but with longer beard His staff looks like an untwisted version of the staff gifted to Tom Holland\n",
      " Holland is 16 but wearing a college sweatshirt The same college name is on a pennant on the wall of his bedroom He could be a prodigy going to college early but theres no back from college vibe more of a high school kid vibe Especially in the teaser trailer from May So Im thinking hes set his sights on this college and wears the sweatshirt as a symbol or intentional thing to separate himself from his brother\n",
      " In an early shot in the trailer the shoulder on his college sweatshirt is visibly torn and Holland clutches at the tear looking sadannoyedbothered Presumably because of something Pratt did Hes trying to get away from Pratt as he does his theatrical dub you a man now shtick\n",
      " The Dadsummoning has inconsistent spatial arrangements of the characters something else is going on there thats being hidden by the editing Just before the explosion the pose of the brothers looks like Pratt is trying to take the staff away from Holland who is trying to keep it away\n",
      " The lionface monster in the diner with nametag Corey is the real version of the diner mascot character that she attacks Her high heels are way too small for her feet and shes initially posed like some dramatic transformation just overtook her\n",
      " In the brief shot we see of mom swerving around in a minivan the passenger in her car is the Manticore from the diner Theres also a giant sword in the backseat and a bikergang fairy on the windshield\n",
      " In the pandown from the airplane we see the biggest buildings of the city are packed together on the right side of the cityscape Theyre in the style of a castle and look like all the same complex Theres some centralized powerful entity in the city\n",
      " In the convenience store scene Tom Holland is carrying the gas can and tiny Chris Pratt is in his shirt pocket so this happens shortly after the growth spell mistake\n",
      " Lots of icosahedron imagery between Chris Pratts cast his jacket the designs in the spell book and possibly the crystal used in the Dadsummoning scene For Pratt it seems to represent a 20sided die The spell book he opens up at the end has a DnDstyle dieroll guide for the growth spell\n",
      " Crystal with dragon and spiral design also visible on Manticores shoulder tattoo visible in mom minivan scene Same dragon silhouette is on a patch on Pratts jean jacket but without the tail\n",

      " We see Ray Liottas characters twice in the trailer 1st at 145 laughing with a graying pompadour and again 208 with a buzzed head looking visibly older This gives the sense that the movies timeframe may be sprawling over a series of years The blue shirt hes wearing in the second scene may be a prison jump suit and in the background around 205 there appears to be a police officer wearing a hat with police badge on it through the doors This is somewhat bolstered by the scene at 056 it takes a toll where Dicky is also wearing a suit and the back of someone can be seen in the background wearing a similar colored shirt Liotta character couldnt be Erchol DiMeo the timeline wouldnt work but he does appear to be someone of importance or influence and he seems to be unhappy with Dickys decision to involve young Tony\n",
      " Interestingly The scenes at 056 and  208  may not occur and the same time or even the same decade The suits appear slightly different particularly one is darker and the collarsties appear to be distinctive  In the 056 scene the collar is much narrower in a style thats reminiscent of 70s fashion whereas the 208 scene the collar is more open the tie is lose and the collar button is undone The tie knot also appears to be shorter than in the first scene This might occur later on in time Maybe he just unbuttoned it in the middle of a heated exchange but maybe it gives us a sense of the scope of the movie who knows\n",

      " As Ive stated in another response Dicky appears to suffer from some of the same faults and weaknesses as Christopher drinking insubordination etc and it wouldnt be surprising if his eventual death mirrors Christophers in some way being killed by family  Whether Tony actually knows how Dicky really died isnt clear Even in the show Tonys claim is presented as tenuous and unreliable Who killed Dicky and why may not even be clear after this movie but I think were going to get a much more detailed picture of the events that lead up to Dickys demise\n",

      "Just a few points When you first start to learn about slavery in Africa there can be a tendency to collapse a range of different practices conducted by a myriad of different states and kingdoms over a vast time span into a simple and recognizable image that closely resembles most likely Antebellum chattel slavery Yes slavery is universally bad But its useful to differentiate in different times and places how people became slaves what kinds of lives they lived and whether they could ever earn their freedom\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly many historical narratives about the brutality of Dahomey were written bybig surpriseEuropean slave traders with a vested interested in defending their vocation as a humane alternative to the allegedly horrific conditions slaves would face if they were to remain in Africa Actual abolitionists at the time had a very different take on places like Dahomey\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly dont let the Brits get you twisted Colonialism wasis just another form of slavery They may have abolished the slave trade and used their navy to enforce it mostly for their own economic selfinterest but they simply replaced slaves with indentured servitude and apprenticeship which in many cases were just as bad if not worse Both the British and French wanted domination of West Africa So a movie about the Fon defending themselves against European invaders is not on a surface level inaccurate\n",
