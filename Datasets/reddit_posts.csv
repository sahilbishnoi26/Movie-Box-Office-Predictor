I’m currently intrigued by metacinema and looking for movies that specifically are about actors acting and finding their process for a role.

Two recent examples are Clouds of Sils of Maria (2014) and May December (2024).

Both feature characters who are actors preparing for roles and working out how to inhabit their characters.

Do you happen to know of other films like this?

What trailer had captivating music and editing that locked your atenttion?

For me its easily the trailer for The Handmaiden. It actually should win some award just for the trailer. It instantly hooks you with that hypnotic beat that doesnt relent at all. The quick provocative clips get you even more interested in the story and characters.
And whats even more incredible is that it tells you nothing about the story. It avoids the biggest problem with modern trailers. Giving up too much of the plot before you even see it. After watching the movie and returning to the trailer was even more incredible. I learned nothing from the trailer.

After District 9 (not seen this one), Elysuim (thought this was good) and Chappie (it was ok) - according to IMDB he only did short films for years until last year.

If he's got ""sidelined"" by Hollywood do you think its got anything to do the with concept art that he did for alien without the studio's permission, I heard they weren't too happy about that.

Edit - looks like a lot of people seem to have a hard time with me not seeing D9 and don't understand why I would post such a question without seeing it - the answer to that is easy, seen the trailers and clips, it didn't like the look of it, but the overwhelming view is that it's regarded as a good film.",228.0,417.0,1675730865.0,Discussion,Chappie

52,we3mxs,The ending of The Age of Adaline made me actively angry (SPOILERS),https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/we3mxs/the_ending_of_the_age_of_adaline_made_me_actively/,"This whole post is a spoiler for the end of the movie. Do not read if you plan to see the movie.

Netflix just added The Age of Adaline, and the premise seemed really interesting. The plot is basically as follows; one woman becomes immortal through a scientific fluke (car accident with funky weather conditions in a lake with lightning), and has spent the last hundred or so years with a physical age of 28 years old. At one point the government gets wise to the fact she doesn't age, and after a close encounter Adaline adopted a policy of changing her identity every decade. Beyond that, it's a classic boy-meets-girl story but with the whole novel immortality twist.

I wanted good writing, and I wanted deep thinking about what someone in her situation would do. I wanted them to build a believable world, given their premise. And they did it! The beginning of the movie was excellent, and was everything I was hoping for when I read the synopsis. I loved how the character felt wise and old beyond her years, I loved how she became friends with blind people so that she could maintain friendships for longer than the lifespan of her alias'. The meet-cute part wasn't bad either, and I enjoyed the conflict Adaline felt between her situation and her attraction for the lead guy. I quite enjoyed the fact she had loved and left his father in the past, made for an interesting ""getting to meet the parents"" dynamic and really let the premise of this world naturally carry the story behind it. She just wants to grow old with someone and not have heartbreak every time she outlives them, yet she can't or she will  end up as a lab specimen for the remainder of her immortal life. Brilliant idea well executed.

**And then they ruined it.**

She ran away, as she did in the past, and decided to turn around this time and risk letting people know and trying to live out this life - so she stops by the side of a lake while there are funky weather conditions and her love interest crashes into her car while racing back to stop her from leaving. Suddenly she can get old again! HOORAY!

**Fuck you.**

The entire thing that made this movie interesting was that its main character had to make difficult choices, grapple with the real problems that came with her immortality, come up with interesting thought provoking solutions to something I hadn't considered much prior to this. Throwing all of that away so there could be a fucking fairytale *""and they lived happily ever after""* perfect fuckin' happy ending is **bullshit**. *""Oh thank god everything worked out so perfectly!""* Dammit, the beauty of this story WAS THE PROBLEMS! Hell, you could even have just had her decide to face her problems so she can get with the guy, and then fade to black. Roll credits. Fine. I get that stories have to end. But they could have had the fuckin' *""meet and kiss in the rain""* ending while still keeping the heart of the story alive - they didn't have to ruin the whole fucking premise by bending the arc of plot inevitability to force a perfect ending. 

A perfect ending would have been Adaline confessing her unaging reality to her super rich boyfriend, and them together walking off discussing how they can ensure she lives in an increasingly online world, how to keep her safe, how their relationship will work when she almost married his Dad 40 years ago, etc. There was still story left, *fucking interesting story*, and they just... didn't. They threw it all away for the Hallmark Special. Dammit, they also threw away the chance for a sequel! What if every few years we get a new look at Adaline at a different period of time? Have her follow along with modern times? Every time she starts the new decade by leaving the last guy (or outliving him)? Coulda been like a Bond thing. ""Who's gonna be the new Adaline? I really like so-and-so!""

But no. This movie was brimming with potential, yet rather than keep the only thing that separated this movie from every other romcom in the metaphorical $5 movie bin they chucked the entire reason this movie was working to get their happy ending.

Fuck you, J. Mills Goodloe and  and Salvador Paskowitz. Fuck. You.",129.0,108.0,1659419424.0,Spoilers,The Age of Adaline

121,3wwm75,Just saw an advanced screening of Anomalisa. I think it broke me. I'm broken now. [No spoilers],https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3wwm75/just_saw_an_advanced_screening_of_anomalisa_i/,"([Here's](https://youtu.be/DT6QJaS2a-U) the trailer if you're unfamiliar)

Damn.

It's a strikingly simple story and yet devastatingly effective. I would've loved to have been a fly on the wall when Charlie Kaufman pitched the story ideas for Being John Malkovich, or Adaptation, or Eternal Sunshine, or Synecdoche, but this would've been an extremely simple pitch. That's all I'll say.

Contrasting Kaufman's last film, Synecdoche New York, which takes place over the course of an entire lifetime, Anomalisa takes place over the course of a day. But like Caden in Synecdoche, Michael in Anomalisa is a broken man looking for something he's lost (or perhaps something he's never had but always wanted): a human connection. Meaning. Answers. To feel...better.

There's a choice they made about the voice acting that's a little off-putting at first. But there's a reason for it. There's a choice they made about the design of the characters' faces that's a little off-putting at first. But there's a reason for it.

Eventually, I forgot I was watching puppets (or, not puppets, whatever you call them).

If I were to find one common thread among all of Kaufman's movies so far, from Being John Malkovich to Anomalisa, it would be *loneliness*. And while loneliness may have been the subtext of Malkovich, Human Nature, Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine, and Synecdoche, it's full on *text* in Anomalisa, and it's explored deeper and more creatively than I can remember seeing in a movie.

Now I just really need a hug.",477.0,150.0,1450160426.0,Review,Anomalisa

157,69rltt,The time it takes for the movie to start is starting to feel ridiculous.,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/69rltt/the_time_it_takes_for_the_movie_to_start_is/,"I don't go to the movies too terribly often, maybe 5-10 times a year, but it seems like the span between the time on your ticket stub to the time the movie is actually starting is getting increasingly large.

I went to see Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 last night (only a few issues, otherwise a lot of fun and worth the ticket) at 7pm. At 7:00, the trailers began. If I am remembering correctly, the trailers that played were Transformers, Spider Man, Thor, Wonder Woman, Valerian, The Mummy, Kingsman, and Star Wars. I may be forgetting one, but at least those 8 trailers played. Each trailer had this stupid screen afterwards reminding us to make sure we see it in their super awesome extreme mega-badass theater (whatever it's called).

After the trailers, there was your usual couple of ads telling you to turn off your phone followed by an annoyingly lengthy ad telling us how great the theater is that we are currently sitting in, followed by one of those needlessly long sound test ads (I miss you THX), followed by a final ad telling everyone to enjoy the movie. Towards the end of all this, you could tell that the audience was getting impatient, and there were several audible sighs and other comments.

When the little Marvel Studios animation started, I checked the time. 7:32. We had all just sat through 32 minutes of what are essentially ads. Now don't get me wrong, I love trailers and look forward to seeing a few, but 8+ trailers followed by like 5-10 minutes of extraneous advertising felt exhausting and ridiculous. Maybe I should stop watching the trailers when they show up here on Reddit? Maybe I should be one of those people and show up late to the movie? I'm not sure. I don't imagine every theater is the same experience, but I can assume most big theater chains have the same policy.

Anyway, just wanted to rant a bit.

EDIT: Just to address some common responses:

 * This was a Cinemark in Texas.
 * I like showing up early because I get all anxious about having a good seat. If I can buy reserved seating, I'll always pick that option.
 * 5 to 10 movie visits a year is probably too high an estimate for me. I always THINK I will go see a movie, and don't end up doing it. 3-5 visits a year is probably more accurate for me and even that is apparently more frequent than your average redditor. Could be worth a [strawpoll](http://www.strawpoll.me/12916839).

EDIT 2: Added Kingsman to the trailer list. That was the 8th trailer I forgot about.

FINAL EDIT: Fixed a typo. Also thanks to everyone for the discussion and participating in the poll. The results were somewhat expected, but it's still nice to see.

Films that really make you feel something...,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1au75z9/suggestions_for_best_emotionally_disturbing_films/,"Hey everyone, I know this question gets asked every so often, but lately the list of suggestions for ""fucked up movies"" has really been leading me to waste time on a lot of trash. I am not opposed to horror but I feel like often times people mistake blood and gore for disturbing so hopefully some of y'all can give me suggestions on things to watch.

Let me preface this by saying I would rather spend 2 hours watching something trying to be unique and thought provoking and not like it, rather than watch a decent rehashing of the same old song and dance. Some of the films on my list of didn't like were still films I enjoyed, just not what I am actively seeking out at the moment.

I spend a lot of time watching movies and have found that the ones that really hit home for me are films that are disturbing but not for the sake of being disturbing, they just happen to have an amazing story to tell that usually involves messed up subject matter. I would love some suggestions on films that left you with a very visceral feeling, could be heartache, loss, depression, anxiety, whatever. I am open to any genre, but typically horror movies leave me feeling ""meh.""

Here are some examples of movies that I feel really hit the nail on the head:

-Dancer in the Dark
-if...
-Breaking the Waves
-Love Liza
-Antichrist
-Irreversible
-Blue Valentine
-The Master
-The Machinist
-Mysterious Skin
-Martyrs
-Requiem for a Dream
-A Clockwork Orange
-Mother!
-Kids
-Gummo
-Ichi the Killer
-The Wailing
-I Saw the Devil
-Funny Games
-Grave of the Fireflies
-Heaven Knows What
-All Quiet on the Western Front
-Come and See
-Oldboy 
-God Only Forgives
-The Neon Demon
-Lady Vengeance
-Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance
-Parasite
-Nocturnal Animals
-Lilya 4 ever
-Incendies
-Men
-American History X
-Shutter Island
-Pusher
-The Handmaiden
-Prisoners
-This is England
-The Wrestler
-Buzzard
-Stoker
-Suicide Club
-Cold Fish
-Candy
-Akira
-Blue Valentine
-Angst
-Raw
-Bad Boy Bubby
-The Strangers
-Out of the Furnace
-Bones & All

Here are a few that I was suggested that really did not resonate me and would like to avoid any suggestions similar to them (not that these were too disturbing, just not great films imo, or did not have much to them other than trying to be shocking):

-Cannibal Holocaust
-Nymphomaniac I & II
-Frontier(s)
-Salo
-Hard Candy
-Visitor Q
-Speak No Evil
-The Sadness
-I Spit on Your Grave (original)
-Eden Lake
-Human Centipede (actually have not seen it but I have almost zero interest, feel free to make a case for it if you think it is a good movie but I find it hard to give this one a chance honestly).

I am sure I am forgetting some in both categories, but hopefully you get the idea. Would love to hear any suggestions, thanks!",37.0,321.0,1708295959.0,Discussion,I Spit on Your Grave III: Vengeance Is Mine

McFarland, USA - OK, so this was recommended to me because I am a Cross Country coach and actually, my students are not all that different from the kids in this movie.

I'd love to have as many talented athletes as Jim White has in this movie. I don't know how he managed(in real life) to win so many state championships, but it is super impressive.

The movie is OK, but is not all that different from any other sports movie involving coaching. Hoosiers is the vastly superior movie and is probably the best movie in the genre. This movie, however, does work.

I enjoyed this movie in some parts, but I really think it is overly long. It's over two hours and feels like a 100 minute movie extended. 

Anyway, Cross Country coach comes in and coaches a bunch of rag-tag guys to a championship. You can visualize most of this movie without even seeing it. It works pretty well.",1.0,3.0,1563041939.0,,"McFarland, USA"

I saw it was on Netflix (UK) and that the director was the same guy who directed 'Call Me By Your Name' which turned out to be a film i thought i'd be completely disinterested in, but it turned out to be a great film.

So, i decided to give 'A Bigger Splash' another go and i really enjoyed it. Ralph Fiennes has got to be one of the best actors in the world and i love his character in this, as annoying as someone like that could be.

I think i related to his quest of trying to win back his ex and failing.

I didn't know where the film was going, so it had the surprise factor too.

Don't get me wrong, this film isn't perfect, and i noticed it garnered quite a few bad reviews, but i think it was well made with great performances. The characters are all arty successful types, which can rub some people up the wrong way, as they live privlidged lives.

I wonder what other people's opinions are on this movie? - and if anyone saw it twice and liked it more afterwards..",1.0,2.0,1698572533.0,Recommendation,A Bigger Splash

75% of the movie is based on Kurt and his transformation into a superstar. The last 25% is about Bean and his regenerating into a great father, but at the same time the demise of himself. It’s one of the best biographical documentaries that I’ve seen. The biggest con of the movie is the timeline of the audio recordings, video, and voice-overs done. Rarely do the journal entries match up with the timeline of Kurt writing/drawing them. Anyone else feel the same way?

I’m hesitant to even give examples because I don’t want to spoil anything, but I’m talking like the famous alien scene, the iconic scenes in the shining, things like that

So many awesome movies that I already knew the gist of because they were parodied in things like the Simpsons. So many scenes spoiled for me from growing up watching the Simpsons haha",550.0,341.0,1621012258.0,Discussion,Miss You Already

On one hand they are cool and get you hyped and gives you an idea of what you are going to watch but on the other hand specifically movies about life I feel like would be better to watch going in blind not knowing what is about are what’s the conflict in this persons life. So that being said what are some of the best movies to watch going in blind not watching the trailer or reading the plot synopsis

I'm a senior in high school and this movie perfectly captured the awkwardness and social anxiety some teenagers get. I'm a guy but I feel like Nadine and I could switch places (besides the whole best friend part) she was relatable and funny.

I haven't been so in love with a coming of age film since Perks of being a wallflower but that was dated back to the mid 80's early 90's, but I'll be telling my friends about this one for sure.

I can't even begin to explain how awesome Kubo is because it's an Experience, but I'll try....

- It's all stop motion... this is important because I caught myself multiple times thinking it was all computer animated. No, every single scene except for some minor background is all hand created art, models, sculptures, and passion. 

- The detail is unparalleled. In every scene you could pause it...and just look at everything that went into that frame.

- The story is formulaic... But this sets the bar for every movie after and how they should follow that formula.

- I was so personally invested in the movie that I didn't realize something about a couple of the characters until it was spelled out for me... Which is AMAZING. This movie is so well written, it really keeps you in the main characters shoes..... and I won't spoil anything.

So that's my spiel... I have always had a thing for animated movies but this takes the cake. If even a couple people see this and watch it.......it will make me happy.....as I think this movie will make YOU happy.

I was 10 years old when I first discovered the comic Valerian and Laureline and making this adaptation has been a passion project throughout my career. It has greatly influenced me as a filmmaker (the comic’s co-creator Jean-Claude Mézieres also worked on THE FIFTH ELEMENT, which is celebrating its 20-year anniversary this May) and I can’t wait to share the final film with you this July. Brief synopsis for VALERIAN below as well.
 

Let’s chat about VALERIAN, epic science fiction, and anything you want! THANK YOU so much for the questions. I have to run to finish the film if you want to see it on July 21. Let's chat again after you have seen the film! Adios amigos.

In the 28th century, Valerian (Dane DeHaan) and Laureline (Cara Delevingne) are a team of special operatives charged with maintaining order throughout the human territories. Under assignment from the Minister of Defense, the two embark on a mission to the astonishing city of Alpha—an ever-expanding metropolis where species from all over the universe have converged over centuries to share knowledge, intelligence and cultures with each other. There is a mystery at the center of Alpha, a dark force which threatens the peaceful existence of the City of a Thousand Planets, and Valerian and Laureline must race to identify the marauding menace and safeguard not just Alpha, but the future of the universe.",5749.0,920.0,1490795858.0,AMA,Marauders

398,p50yq5,"Over 10 years ago, I made the decision to stop watching trailers. It was the most impactful and enriching decision I ever made for my moviegoing experience. Anyone else here pro-media blackout?",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/p50yq5/over_10_years_ago_i_made_the_decision_to_stop/,"The year was 2010. I had just stepped out of the theater after seeing *Inception* for the first time. It would go on to be one of my favorite films of all time. After deliberating about the many theories my friends and I had, I eventually had a come-to-Jesus moment: as much as I enjoyed the film, I probably would have been even more blown away if I didn't watch the trailers for that film. The hallway fight scene, the city folding up over itself, the zero-G scenes, they all would have come as a complete surprise to me had I not seen the trailers.

So, I decided to stop watching all trailers from then on out. No more trailers for films that I was excited for or expecting to see.

I think it has easily been the most game-changing decision I've ever made to help me enjoy films I probably would have already liked, and take them to the next level. All I did was implement a simple 2-step plan:

1. Whenever a trailer played in theaters, I'd either close my eyes or check my phone. Obviously you can still hear the trailer, but you'd be surprised at how quickly you can forget a trailer if you have no images to pair the audio with.
2. In order to find movies to be excited about, I'd simply check websites to determine my excitement level: Hollywood Reporter, Slashfilm, Collider, just to name a few. Although some of those websites have some god-awful takes on films, I use them more for when they actually report movie news. I also have a decent grasp of what directors/actors I enjoy seeing, so that just made everything easier.

After seeing the movie, I'd finally watch the trailers to see how much they reveal. It's amazing how much studios will reveal just to get you to watch their film. I've never felt so much relief watching some of these trailers knowing that the best parts weren't spoiled for me. While I'd say that not watching trailers has pretty much benefited me for every film that I've seen since then, here are just a few specific memories I've had that I'll remember forever going in completely blind for a film:

* The fight scenes for ***The Raid 2***. Seeing those characters with the ridiculous fighting weapons and all of the set pieces they had without knowing anything was incredible, especially in a theater filled with people OOHing and AAHing.
* Seeing The Bat in ***The Dark Knight Rises***. I was always a huge fan of Nolan's interpretation of the modern Batmobile, so I was just as curious to see his take on the Bat Wing in his third film. Seeing it emerge from the dark alley with that crazy engine was pure movie bliss.
* The fire/sandstorm from ***Mad Max: Fury Road***. Granted, everything in that film was pretty much complete madness, but seeing that along with all the guys flying around on a big screen without having seen any of that was amazing.
* Seeing the ships and boarding scene in ***Arrival***. They tease the ever-loving crap out of you as to what the ships look like from the start of the film, right until the first shot of the vessels. It was glorious. The ship boarding scene was an incredible visual experience since I had no expectation as to how they were going to do it, but IIRC that's like the entire premise of one of their trailers. Not knowing what the aliens looked like was also huge.
* The cinematography of ***Blade Runner 2049***. Seeing Villeneuve and Deakins do more than just honor Ridley Scott's legacy of the original BR was pure eye candy for its 2.5 hour runtime.
* All of ***Mission: Impossible - Fallout***. Every single scene. While I have to admit that its [first trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb49-oV0F78) is quite possibly one of the greatest trailers of all time, it reveals a hell of a lot. Not knowing what any of the stunts were made this viewing an actual religious experience.
* The infamous running scene in ***1917***. Even my friend who saw the film with me afterwards was like, ""I wish I didn't watch the trailer for that."" That running scene has to be one of the most breathtaking moments in cinema history for me.

Anyway, thanks everyone for indulging me. I'd love to hear of other film lovers memories of when going media-blackout greatly benefited their movie-going experience. Does anyone not watch trailers, or is anyone planning on doing so?

EDIT: Wow, really really surprised by the amount of people who felt the same way! I'm glad there's people like us out there...and have definitely been reading the comments. Duly noted about taking my phone out during trailers, I won't do that anymore. Thanks y'all!",20507.0,1975.0,1629058868.0,,Collide

502,65nqfd,Not watching trailers made movies significantly better,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/65nqfd/not_watching_trailers_made_movies_significantly/,"I don't know if this was posted somewhere before, but years ago I decided to not watch trailers specifically because they were ruining movies for me one way or another. Growing up trailers were my favorite thing. I loved being hyped for a movie to come out. However, numerous times trailers have spoilers for movies coming out. Even if the trailer doesn't have a ""spoiler"" it can have a scene from the end of the movie that you're waiting for that can count as a spoiler. An example without trying to do a spoiler in an actual movie is that you see a character from the movie that does something you haven't seen yet, but they just had a scene where they are supposed to be dead and now you know they aren't because they haven't done the scene from the trailer yet. 


Spoilers aside a lot of times people who do the trailer portray the movie incorrectly then how you do once you watch the movie. This causes you to go into the movie with a preconceived notion that the movie is about X and really it's about Y, but thinking it was about X makes you not enjoy the movie. A good example of this, for me personally and all my friends, was watchmen. That was one of the last trailers I watched and without having read the comics just judging by the trailer I thought it was going to be non stop action. 


After only watching movies based on titles/actors/posters it has dramatically increased my movie watching experience. You let the movie tell you the story without trying to make it fit your mindset of what it should be based on the trailer. Also, try to avoid reviews. A lot of reviews are from people who don't have the same likes and dislikes as you, but thinking a movie sucks because you read a bunch of people hating it can make you try to focus on all the negatives on the movie. 

tl;dr Try watching movies without seeing an reviews or trailers on it. You'll likely enjoy it much more.",37109.0,2504.0,1492321947.0,Discussion,Better Watch Out

A former boxer named Bradley loses his job as an auto mechanic, and his troubled marriage is about to expire.

I would rather watch a Sci Fi film with no budget and no expectations than this pile.

It's so facinating to me just how much of a mess this film is; every time I leave finding more and more scenes that just make me scratch my head. A character will walk into a room, just say some incoherent babble, and walk out. 

Why does the brother bring an 8 year old child to a college party? Why does the psychic say, ""he makes you see things that arent there, like trains"" and then IMMEDIATELY stop the car to walk in front of a train? Why can't the black dude get a boner? Is that one of the Bye Bye Man's powers? Instant ED? Why is Ms. Watkins? Just why anything with her? Why does no one react to anything like an actual human being? I NEED TO KNOW!

I submit this film to replace the Pyramids of Giza in the 8 wonders of the world because I care more about how this movie got made more than the fucking pyramids.

**Summary:** Ingrid Thorburn is an unhinged social media stalker with a history of confusing ""likes"" for meaningful relationships. Taylor Sloane is an Instagram-famous ""influencer"" whose perfectly curated, boho-chic lifestyle becomes Ingrid's latest obsession. When Ingrid moves to LA and manages to insinuate herself into the social media star's life, their relationship quickly goes from #BFF to #WTF. Built around a brilliantly disarming performance from Aubrey Plaza, Ingrid Goes West is a savagely hilarious dark comedy that satirizes the modern world of social media and proves that being #perfect isn't all it's cracked up to be.

I've always been a huge Star Wars fan, and after some initial jadedness due to the prequels, I was hyped when the announced Star Wars was back.  I still think the trailer is the best I've ever seen.  It's exactly what a trailer should be...doesn't give too much away, while still sending your senses into overdrive.  

The film itself, though...what a disappointment.  I'm obviously not the only one who has brought up these points before, Rey's invincibility and know it all nature, Finn's goofiness, the underuse of Phasma, poorly written and acted Kylo Ren, the hackneyed plot, the mediocre score...it just all a big let down.  The potential was there, but they played it way too safe.  Some of the film's weaknesses and nonsense can be made a easier to take if properly explained in The Last Jedi, although I don't understand how they'll explain certain things, like why Phasma gave up so easily, among others.

576,65hpca,Sandy Wexler (Adam Sandler's Netflix movie) is surprisingly funny,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/65hpca/sandy_wexler_adam_sandlers_netflix_movie_is/,"Bring on the downvotes, I am currently watching Sandy Wexler on Netflix and I've been laughing out loud a bunch of times, and believe me, I was done with Adam Sandler. I found absolutely no redeeming qualities in Ridiculous Six and The Do-Over, I know some people can enjoy his latest movies with a guilty pleasure approach but that was not even the case for me.

Point being, Sandy Wexler on Netflix is worth a shot if you can handle Adam Sandler's performance because I admit it's very stupid, but his character keeps lying and I think they have some pretty good jokes in the script. If you gave up on Adam Sandler, maybe give it a shot, I can't promise you will like it but I am enjoying so far. (The 2h11 runtime seems a bit excessive, I am halfway through and I admit I was surprised I still had 1 hour left but it's fun, a good 6/10 so far).",76.0,80.0,1492236717.0,,Sandy Wexler

Lara Jean Covey, a junior in high school, writes love letters to each of her past crushes. Fairly shy and reserved, she writes as a form of catharsis, with no intention to send the letters. After the letters are sent out mysteriously to the five recipients, her quiet life takes a turn. One boy in particular, Peter Kavinsky, takes an interest in Lara Jean; the two begin forming a connection over a secret pact they make as a result of the letter.

She is extremely lucky most people have forgotten this exist. 


It literally kicks off with her laughing at the fact that her naive hairstylist was drugged and rapped. It also includes:

- Mocking an old childhood friend she called up to appear in the doc. 

- Verbally abuses her manager

-  Mocks her father for politely  saying he felt uncomfortable going to her show if she simulated masturbation on stage, telling him she wouldn’t do it at the show he attended, and then doing it anyway  

-  abusing her closeted background dancer because he didn’t want to come out 

- Visiting her mother’s grave and rolling around on with the dry eyes in such a facetious way that visibly disgusted the brother who went with her 
 

- Attempts to seduce a married Antonio Banderas

- Demeans Keven Costner for calling her show “neat”. 

- Forcing another background dancer(Black) to show his penis in a game of “Truth or Dare” and then mocking it’s appearance 

Edit: Since I’ve gotten a lot of comments on this, she mocked the color as well as the size of his penis. That’s why I mentioned his race. Also, in the scene he’s laughing along but he later asked her to cut it out because he was embarrassed. She refused. 

- Stuffing half a glass bottle down her throat to simulate oral sex(not objectively bad but surprisingly cringe and unsexy when she did it)

- Generally rude, pretentious, and demeaning in every scene.



The best part of the doc is when she’s whining at Warren Beatty for like 10 minutes and refuses to turn of the cameras so they can talk privately. He mockingly tells the director""She doesn't want to live off-camera, much less talk... What point is there of existing off-camera?"".

Edit: I in no way want to see Madonna cancelled. That wasn’t the purpose of my post. There’s no need to work yourself into a tizzy defending the multimillionaire.",41641.0,5231.0,1617105744.0,Discussion,Truth or Dare

I haven’t seen the film, but I couldn’t help notice in the trailers for [You Should Have Left](https://www.youshouldhaveleftmovie.com/?utm_source=sGoogleSearch&utm_medium=Search&utm_campaign=YSL_US_m_105928570950&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlPmGw7T-6QIVxR6tBh2lBAoVEAAYASAAEgIw2fD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), the woman (Amanda Siegfried) they cast as Kevin Bacon’s wife is kinda hilariously young. She looks especially young juxtaposed with his wrinkly, concerned “oh no a ghost!” face.  
She was born in 1986.  Bacon married Kyra Sedgwick in 1988.  When Bacon was her age (34) he was acting in Oliver Stone’s JFK (1991).  

Maybe it’s because I’m getting older, I’m noticing this.  Any other obvious May-December castings?

My own thoughts from the movie:  The study was completely f'd up and I still can't understand how people were ok with this happening.

1.  It is interesting that the psychologist was a former holocaust survivor.  Did he ever consider that what he was doing was wrong and similar to what the nazis did?   We will never know but it's intriguing.

2.  Still not sure what conclusions I should draw from the parts of the study presented and how the movie presented them.  I think the movie has so many questions than answers.

3. Did you like the woman research assistant?  Does anyone know her name and why she knew so many famous people?

4.  What was your favorite part of the movie?

5.  Anyone find themselves saying ""oh shit""?

Now if you are hiding from the spoilers above I will tell you that both spoilers are are common knowledge about this movie. But if you know nothing about this movie. There is a very good chance you may have the same kind of reaction i had... Aside from me hyping it up. I was not prepared for a twist. You are now hyped up for a twist.  

It is nothing huge, but being ignorant to certain facts about this movie changed the fucking game for me. I recommend you get it and watch it without looking at the box art or learning ANYTHING.   

So what amazing discoveries and cool experiences have you had with films, that were not intended to be twists?  ",144.0,279.0,1484756277.0,Discussion,Breaking In
754,1561d07,Hudson Hawk feels like its target audience is eight year olds whose parents encourage swearing. I do not understand it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1561d07/hudson_hawk_feels_like_its_target_audience_is/,"I've seen people mention Hudson Hawk here for a while now and it's generally been in the context of ""I like this film but I know people as a whole don't"" or ""this is a bad film"". I watched it recently and... it doesn't really make sense to me.

Pretty much everything in Hudson Hawk feels like it belongs to a children's film except the occasional bursts of swearing. It's honestly like they found a script where Hudson Hawk was an anthropomorphic cat who was a cat burglar (because that's funny), decided to do it in live action and then added some swearing in as an afterthought. Yet, it seems to have been genuinely written for adults.

I don't watch trailers for anything that isn't a new release so maybe if I had I'd have calibrated my expectations appropriately (though I see it has a terrible Cinemascore so perhaps not), but this was honestly one of the most surreal experiences I've had watching a movie.",138.0,157.0,1689976203.0,Discussion,Calibre

783,q2fbj8,The problem with Netflix running trailers right after a movie ends….,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/q2fbj8/the_problem_with_netflix_running_trailers_right/,"Last night, I was watching “The Boy in the Striped Pajamas” for the first time with my wife. Boy oh boy, that was a gut wrenching ending. I mean, the whole movie was an emotional ride for me. I was deep into my seat. As that final shot of the mother and daughter faded to black and the credits started rolling, I was filled with feelings that I wanted to ruminate on for a bit. Emotions that I wanted to savor. I had but 10 seconds of that until…

“WAAAASSSSSSUUUUUUUUUUUP?!”

Yes. A trailer for Scary Movie burst onto my screen like the damn Kool Aide Man. Oh, yeah. I was livid. I was not happy.

It completely ruined the end of the movie for me. I can’t remember when, but this isn’t the first time Netflix did this with a post movie trailer. I find all of it unnecessary and jarring. I mean, I already had Scary Movie on my watch later list.

Has this ever happened to you? Is there a setting I can change? Should I write a strongly worded letter to Netflix?",27090.0,1488.0,1633504641.0,Discussion,After

I am fascinated by this. I don’t think it’s ever been done before. My question is, do we know how they are keeping the countdown going? When I see a film in theaters, does the trailer play from a file that is specific to that showing? Does the trailer or even the numbers themselves stream live?

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw** - So last week I was out because work was just......sorry done with my existential angst. Anyways let's talk large slabs of meat punching. Hobbs & Shaw was #1 for the second weekend in a row with an underwhelming $25.3M domestic. Hobbs & Shaw is a fascinating experiment in brand management, something of a concession for the fighting parties of a major franchise as well as a big step in a new direction. It's no secret Rock and Vin despise each other and this shared custody branching off of the franchise will allow Rock to keep rocking and Vin to keep mi familia-ing. But it seems that Rock and co may have overstated how much ""Fast & Furious Presents"" would allow Rock to keep the massive money train all on him. While H&S debuted last week to the worst opening weekend for the franchise since 2006's Best Picture winner Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift, it is an August release and August releases are prime for the longtail, as major films compete to be the one to hit that sweet Guardians of the Galaxy spot where you open okay but keep churning out money for months. But this weekend seems to prove that this film may not have the juice as it dropped 57.7%. While that's similar to Guardians' 52% drop on its second weekend, that film opened $35M higher. 
* **Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw** (cont.) -This is also to note that internationally the film has just crossed $330M. Decent but again we don't live in an age where decent id enough for a $200M blockbuster that's EXPECTED to cross $500M in two weekends. And no, I'm not saying Universal is packing up the goods and cancelling the whole wild Fast & Furious experience. Or even that its killing Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw & Hobbs - Revengeance: Age of Innocence anytime soon. More proof that brand management is really damn hard and even with a killer two ampersand title and the biggest movie star in the world you may not tap into that sweet surreal vein that can be so fickle and seems to constantly be moving. Perhaps I'll eat my word when H&S closes but for now, it just stands as a weird not all that winning experiment. But hey it came from a series built on wild experimentation and change. And also terribly clunky titles. Some things should never die!
* **Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark -** It must have been so annoying to hack box office people that Scary Stories only made it to #2 with $20.8M. You know they wanted to do a classic ""scares up"" pun but does #2 justify it? Anyways the adaptation of the popular children's spooky scary book was a rather interesting play of the four major new wide releases this week. August is a rather strange time for horror, too early for the more lucrative fall lead-in to Halloween and too close to the summer months to really fit in. But the value of this film is definitely in it coming in just two weeks before the majority of students return to school and this was intended as a straight to tweens/teens horror film with its PG-13 rating and young Stranger Things/IT/ummm-I-guess-Riverdale cast instead of appealing straight for that sweet nostalgia. In that regard the film did alright as 44% of the audience was under the age of 25. But the film got middling reviews from critics and a not great C rating on Cinemascore. Of course this could be the case of generational difference as older folks might be more frustrated with the film pushing aside the classic stories as part of a larger overall narrative while younger folks unfamiliar with the classic spooks might find it fun. Next weekend will tell sure (same goes for all of these films I'm discussing this week) but with a cool $20M budget this one should end up just fine no matter what.
* **Dora and the Lost City of Gold -** I appreciate we live in a time where a $50M Dora the Explorer movie exists and we all go ""oh yeah...uh-huh of course that exists"". But hey it's real and now we have to talk about another film doing some weird bit of semi-satirical take on sincere pop culture ephemera. This is to say it opened at #4 with $17M. The film pushes Dora in to high school but still maintains a fun family adventure vibe. Critics weren't insane for it but did appreciate the charm and style. However audiences that did see Dora dug it a lot, giving it an A on Cinemascore. A weird kid friendly bit of tongue in cheek humor based on a Spanish language program for very small children is ummmm a choice so I don't find the $17M opening too tragic as it's just a bit too strange to justify a massive opening. However again with that insane $50M budget it does really need to hold very well in the next coming weeks before school starts to justify costs. So again the next few weeks will really define this film's future and also the course for our continuously crumbling society. Make the $80M Street Shark movie. Just do it, let's get it over with.
* **The Art of Racing in the Rain -** Have we reached peak dog movie or have we reached peak ""have we reached"" articles because that one could actually exist? Whatever the case the case for the death of the dog movie might be The Art of Racing in the Rain (TAORITR for...short?) which opened poorly at #6 to $8.1M. The film based on the popular book by Garth Stein was something of a book blockbuster but over a decade ago in 2008. And perhaps also in a year of tons of dog movies already this just fell to the wayside. Not mention the book itself is a strange fit for this genre as it's far more lyrical and meditative than the wacky Josh Gad semi-spiritual stylings of the A Dog's franchise. Whatever the reason the critics were not fans but audiences gave it a solid A- on Cinemascore. So while it could hold well and carries a smallish $20M budget, it is too far down the pack (boo) and with another FIVE new wide releases coming next week I don't expect it to find its legs . Fuzzy, cute, adroable legs (double boo). Also this is random, but Wikipedia writers did we really need 2,000 words for the plot of this movie? Really? 
* **The Kitchen -** When a film that has a powerhouse trio like Elizabeth Moss, Tiffany Hadish, and serious mode Melissa McCarthy and it doesn't have reviews until the day of release and it's dropped off at the back end of the summer months...yeah you know something is truly rotten. And indeed critics heralded it as ""the worst of the year"" and ""just awful"" and it opened to a terrible #7 with $5.5M. The film is the first directorial effort from Andrea Berloff who wrote Straight Outta Compton and Sleepless. It seems Andrea either did not have the same abilities behind the camera or the film was stripped to ribbons in editing as most critics found the film entirely impossible to follow. Of course WB could tell the stinker they had on their hand as the film was barely marketed and came in on one of the more competitive yet potentially friendly times of the year. It's just an unfortunate affair, a film that had promise in front and behind the camera but some unknown series of events just completely ruined any chance this film ever had.

* [Death to Smoochy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tX81TTs2poI&ab_channel=PedroPaulino) (2002): A kids' show host, Rainbow Randolph, is fired in disgrace while his replacement, Sheldon Mopes, A.K.A. Smoochy the Rhino, finds himself a rising star. Unfortunately for Sheldon, the business of kids' television isn't all child's play.
* [Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiTllYeJc48&ab_channel=TrailerChan) (1998): An oddball journalist and his psychopathic lawyer travel to Las Vegas for a series of psychedelic escapades.
* [Freaked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxtoMckx9-Q&ab_channel=glows) (1993): A vain actor, his best friend, and an activist end up at a mutant freak farm run by a weirdo scientist.
* [Freddy Got Fingered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raLEbdAVYaM&ab_channel=N.B) (2001): An unemployed cartoonist moves back in with his parents and younger brother Freddy. When his parents demand he leave, he begins to spread rumors that his father is sexually abusing Freddy.
* [Nothing But Trouble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uOBF6r040U&ab_channel=VideoDetective) (1991): A businessman and his friends are captured by a sadistic judge and his equally odd family in a bizarre mansion in the backwoods.
* [UHF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iih5a2Zq_JU&ab_channel=RottenTomatoesClassicTrailers) (1989): An unemployed visionary becomes the manager of a local television station. The station becomes a success, with all sorts of hilarious sight gags and wacky humor.
* [Weird Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y60GlyEawvM&ab_channel=UnseenTrailers) (1985): Two high-school nerds use a computer program to literally create the perfect woman, who promptly turns their lives upside-down.",648.0,1557.0,1667613255.0,Discussion,The Upside

I remember watching it in the theaters when it came out and thinking it was just a cool movie because Michael Douglas just goes across Los Angeles wreaking havoc everywhere he goes.

It wasn’t until later when I realized that the movies message is so much deeper. Michael Douglas did an amazing job acting in this movie, and Joel Schumacher  knocked it out of the park directing! 

This movie is so early 90’s but it still translates to today. It’s one of my favorite movies, and it has some amazing scenes.

&#x200B;

Some highlights: (mild spoilers)

* Two black characters on how Toy Story has racist undertones
* One of the kids jokes about motor-boating one of the camp employees. Initially she brushes it off but follows it with ""I'm flattered"".
* A guy unknowingly pissing in a urinal, with two kids hiding underneath it
* One kid speculating they're under attack from Korea, and telling the Asian kid to call it off (which was actually pretty funny)
* Frequent references to one of the kids being ""facehugged"" by one of the aliens - and revealing it was actually the alien's dick 
* An entire product placement montage of the kids flexing their new Adidas gear from an abandoned mall, straight out of a commercial. They're pretty much wearing Adidas headbands, shirts and hats for the second half of the film
* One kid in the movie is dyslexic with numbers. So of course in the climax of the film he has to type in a passcode on a number keypad to save the world. But obviously he's not good with numbers - and mashes the keypad with no success. His friend, seemingly passed out from a blood wound, comes to the rescue and hands him a page *with the numbers scrawled in his own blood.*",65.0,150.0,1558735517.0,Discussion,Rim of the World

##**January** - 8 movies

####Little Women ★★★★
Jan 2nd - [Review](https://boxd.it/VoBKh)

Although I’ve never seen or read any other versions of this story, I found this to be a delightful adaption. I love that the filmmakers didn’t baby the audience, and I felt quite naturally told the story weaving through time. This genre of film is usually something my Mum would love and I would find a bore, but in seeing this film with my mother, the result was ironically the opposite.
  

####Jumanji: The Next Level ★★★½
Jan 4th - [Review](https://boxd.it/VEaxn)

I’d only watched *Welcome to the Jungle* for the first time the previous evening, and while I enjoy this world a lot and love the wacky performances, this film suffers a little from sequelitis, where they just go too hard over complicating the plot.
  

####Spies in Disguise ★★★★
Jan 10th

I thought this was just a really solid animated film. Nothing too emotional like a good Pixar flick, but ticks all the boxes for entertaining the whole family, and isn’t over commercialised like a lot of animated features frustratingly are these days.
  

####1917 ★★★★½
Jan 10th

This film struck me with its beauty, both in its technical achievement and its poetic storytelling. Saw this right when all the WW3 drama was happening in the news and was nervously hoping we wouldn’t be soon about to throw away all the peace that our forefathers had fought for.
  

####Dolittle ★★★
Jan 19th - [Review](https://boxd.it/X1Q7V)

Honestly don’t get why this film was so hated. It’s incredibly silly, but I think it succeeds at what it needs to be.
  

####The Peanut Butter Falcon ★★★½
Jan 19th

A neat and enjoyable little journey. I’m really glad Shia LaBeouf has found some cool projects to work on.
  

####Sorry We Missed You ★★★★½
Jan 19th

This film astounded me with its raw, emotive performances. I only felt a little under-satisfied when it ended with no real resolution.
  

####Bombshell ★★★★
Jan 19th

Really effective drama I thought. What surprised me the most was realising that all of this happened over a year before the Weinstein case. I feel it serves as a strong reminder of what has and undoubtedly still does exist among the industry today.

##**February** - 7 movies

####A Hidden Life ★★★½
Feb 2nd - [Review](https://boxd.it/YjQEF)

I found this to be a very messy film creatively. It’s very long and it just doesn’t quite do enough to hold my attention the entire duration, but there’s enough in it that I can still say I appreciated it on the whole.
  

####Seberg ★★★½
Feb 2nd

Reasonably by the books in terms of filmmaking, but a really solid performance from Kristen Stewart, and something I quite appreciate after watching *Breathless* a few weeks later.

  
####A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood ★★★★
Feb 2nd

A much more moving and creative biopic than I was expecting, and informative for me considering I hadn’t yet seen *Won’t You Be My Neighbour* and knew nothing about Rogers.

  
####Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) ★★★
Feb 8th - [Review](https://boxd.it/YNn5h)

The title speaks for itself. This film is just trying to be a bit too much, but admittedly, also doesn’t suck completely.

  
####La Belle Époque ★★★½
Feb 15th

This film caught my eye in the trailers, but while I can remember enjoying it, unfortunately I can’t say I remember a lot about it, which makes sense given that in my diary entry I said it *“fails to leave a lasting impression.”*

  
####For Sama ★★★★½
Feb 15th

As I said in the notes of my Cinema Trips list, this film just shouldn’t have to exist. It’s an incredibly tragic tale that just makes me angry at the world for being so self serving.

  
####Guns Akimbo ★½
Feb 28th

Another movie that shouldn’t exist. I admit there are a couple cool moments of action and a funny scene with Rhys Darby, but in honesty it feels like quite a dangerous movie to be putting out into the world. Essentially the main character is an absolute arsehole nearing on incel, yet is shown to be the hero of the story with no growth whatsoever.

***

##**March & April** - no movies! 😷

##**May** - 1 movie

####Bait ★★★★
May 23rd - [Review](https://boxd.it/1a0wc7)

An expertly put together feature that uses old film and sound recording techniques to make it feel like something from nearly a hundred years ago.
  
***

##**June** - 5 movies

####Rosie ★★★★
June 13th

What I described as “an unrelenting slice of life”. A very well performed, real feeling film which puts you in the shoes of people that you may not have known have such difficult lives.

  
####Deux Moi ★★★★½
June 17th

I think I have a bit of a soft spot for this film. I found it to be just delightful in every way. It’s sort of a sad/happy anti-romance, which feels rather relatable to me.

  
####Machine ★★★½
June 20th

A nothing special doco which lists off some ‘frightening’ implications of artificial intelligence. While there wasn’t a lot I wasn’t already aware of, I did find it interesting to ponder the moral questions that were posed.

  
####The Assistant ★★★★
June 20th - [Review](https://boxd.it/1d1HUN)

While this film was nothing like I thought based on the trailer, it was so much better. A highly relatable film that very accurately depicts the experience of someone in an entry level position in the film industry.

  
####The Invisible Man ★★★★
June 27th

Enjoyed this film a lot more than I was expecting. Didn’t feel too cliché and actually explored some really interesting ideas.

##**July** - 1 non-festival movie (10 total)

####Waves ★★★★★
July 22nd - [Initial Review](https://boxd.it/1godyv)

This film absolutely blew me away with its emotive filmmaking. I did however originally rate it 4 ½ stars due to the fact that right in the middle of the movie there is one extremely out of place, melodramatic scene that totally derails the pace of the film. Alas, upon rewatch, while I still totally hated that scene, I realised that the rest of the film is so damn good I still can’t remove half a star, and I now rank it among my [top 10 favourite films](https://boxd.it/31vF0) of all time.
  
***
  
##**NZIFF - July / August** - 15 films
These are the films that I saw at the New Zealand International Film Festival. I have a full list of my NZIFF watches [here](https://boxd.it/7uB1O), which contains more in depth notes on every film, although also includes films which I watched at home.

  
####Heroic Losers ★★★★
July 24th

A fun, tight knit heist movie. Nothing much else to say here. It’s A good popcorn flick for a rainy day.

  
####Corpus Christi ★★★½
July 25th

I thought this film was very well made and entertaining, but everything about it, from the language to the religious context, was all very foreign to me and I found it hard to relate to the main character.

  
####True History of the Kelly Gang ★★★★½
July 25th

Highly, highly recommend this film. I love its use of wacky filmmaking techniques which will have you question what it is you’re even watching. While it’s quite a long journey, it ultimately has a powerful message behind it.

  
####My Extraordinary Summer With Tess ★★★★
July 26th

A cute little film which explores some mature emotions through the eyes of a child. A pretty solid, uplifting family film.

  
####The Girl on the Bridge ★★★★½
July 26th

A really informative and powerful documentary about a suicide survivor whose life is now dedicated to helping others in NZ who are dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts on a daily basis. Especially helpful for those that may not understand completely what goes on inside such a person’s head.

  
####Rūrangi ★★★★
July 26th

An NZ tale of a transgender man’s return to his hometown is informative and emotive. This was initially made as a web-series, and was recut into a feature film for the festival, and while it still retains its episodic structure, the overall serial structure fits that of a feature film perfectly.

  
####Exile ★★½
July 27th

A bit disappointing overall, as I quite enjoyed a lot of the small scale drama that the character went through, but it just ended sorta suddenly with little to no resolution.

  
####Relic ★★★★
July 28th

I don’t watch a lot of horror, so was naturally hesitant to seeing it, but ended up really enjoying myself. It was very well crafted and seemed to have some decent meaning behind it.

  
####LOIMATA, The Sweetest Tears ★★★★
July 30th

This is a documentary of a very personal story that feels almost wrong to be shared with a wide audience, but my regards go to the family for sharing. I had no knowledge of the context, as most of the audience at the time probably did, but the feature was well put together so I didn’t have too hard a time connecting with the story. Still would recommend reading just a little about it before watching.

  
####Before Everest ★½
Aug 1st

I hesitate to even call this a feature documentary. It’s so poorly made I was quite astounded that it was featured in the festival. It’s basically just some guy that was offended by something Ed Hillary said about his Dad, and sets out to make this pandering film to clear his Dad’s name... but the doco leads nowhere as he didn’t even find the answers he was looking for.

  
####The Truth ★★★½
Aug 1st

To be honest I barely remember this film. It’s mostly a conversational film, a little like *Before Sunset*. I remember enjoying some of the conversations but not necessarily becoming invested in the characters.

  
####The County ★★★★
Aug 1st

Unfortunately can’t remember heaps about this one either. Must have been reaching festival fatigue. I definitely recall enjoying much of it though, as it has a lot of subtle situational humour which I like.

  
####Ellie and Abbie (and Ellie’s Dead Aunt) ★★★
Aug 2nd

Competing with *Birds of Prey* for the lengthiest title of 2020, this film tries really hard, and I give it an A for effort, but unfortunately in my country an A is a mere passing grade. I really do enjoy the story they were trying to tell, I just wish they’d worked a little more to refine the script because it’s honestly a bit messy, and comes off feeling like a cheap student film. This story deserved more.

  
####Ema ★★
Aug 2nd

For those of you who like to ‘watch it for the plot’, this could be for you. However there really is nothing beyond that. I honestly couldn’t understand anyone’s character motivations or why the story moved in any of the directions that it did.

  
####Wendy ★★★★
Aug 2nd

An exciting end to the festival for me. I was expecting *Wendy* to just be another cheap attempt to reinvigorate an old Disney tale, but this incarnation of Pan & company genuinely tugged at my four-year old heartstrings. It brought me back to a world I had forgotten, in a way which I never expected it to. More brutal. More honest. More beautiful.

####Tenet ★★★★
Aug 31st - [Review](https://boxd.it/1kwsQ7)

I both love and hate this movie. Also was so frustrated by the theatre’s failure to show this in the correct aspect ratio that I rewatched it again in another theatre the next day, but it was just too fresh for me to properly enjoy. Then saw it again in IMAX months later and enjoyed it a lot more, and strangely could hear the dialogue significantly better than I could in the Dolby Atmos theatre.

***

##**September** - 2 movies

####Never Rarely Sometimes Always ★★★★½
Sept 5th

Slow paced but highly engaging film. Sometimes it’s the small stories that I enjoy the most.

  
####The New Mutants ★★
Sept 5th - [Review](https://boxd.it/1l0qdR)

I had mostly forgotten that I’d gone to see this. I wish so much that this film had kept true to its original horror tone, and not ended with such a cookie cutter comic book climax. You can just feel how much the producers forced it to change... and for what?

***

##**October** - 3 movies

####The Trial of the Chicago 7 ★★★★½
Oct 17th - [Review](https://boxd.it/1poSlN)

Whenever I can, I love to catch Netflix movies in theatres. I just love that experience so much and it was absolutely worth it with this. I knew none of the context before seeing this film so found it highly captivating and educational. It was interesting however, to read afterwards about the liberties it takes with the story. I’ll agree that in some cases it did feel a little too Hollywoodish.

  
####Baby Done ★★★
Oct 22nd - [Review](https://boxd.it/1pXb9p)

I’d actually be very interested to hear what international audiences think of this Kiwi film, if it ever comes your way. My main issue is that it draws too much from the Auckland comedy scene, which I don’t personally vibe with.

  
####Babyteeth ★★★★½
Oct 30th

The third great Aussie film from this year. You folk across the ditch are doing some great stuff. This is a highly performance driven, emotive film, delivered with some delightful camerawork and cutting.

***

##**November** - 3 movies

####Savage ★★★★
Nov 2nd

The best drama to come out of NZ this year. Really nicely shot and well structured, with solid performances all around.

  
####Reunion ★★★½
Nov 21st - [Review](https://boxd.it/1t9Doj)

Eerily similar in tone to *Relic*, this NZ horror effectively elicits emotion, but just falls short for me with the flow of its story.

  
####Mank ★★★½
Nov 28th - [Review](https://boxd.it/1tWCuN)

Like with *Citizen Kane*, I found myself enjoying many parts of this film but remaining uncaptivated by the story overall.

***

##**December** - 6 movies

####The Mystery of D.B. Cooper ★★★★½
Dec 5th

Truly fascinating and very well structured film documenting some of the possible ‘D.B. Cooper’ suspects, with some surprisingly chilling evidence. If you know nothing about the only unsolved hijacking in American history, I’d highly recommend watching [Lemmino’s short documentary](https://youtu.be/CbUjuwhQPKs) first, and if that intrigues you, it could be worth checking out this film too.

  
####The Midnight Sky ★
Dec 20th - [Review](https://boxd.it/1wpwmJ)

This is one I wish I had watched on Netflix cause then I could have turned it off halfway through.

  
####When A City Rises ★★★
Dec 22nd - [Review](https://boxd.it/1wSRlF)

I was intrigued to see a documentary about the rebuild of my hometown of Christchurch, and it’s mostly a reasonably well structured doco, but unfortunately isn’t quite as well made as it could have been and the narrative does feel slightly skewed in one direction.

  
####Wonder Woman 1984 ★★½
Dec 23rd - [Review](https://boxd.it/1wOTBx)

This feels like a film where no one could agree on where the story should go, so they all compromised and just had little bits of the story they wanted. From the bloated unnecessary opening sequence, to the *Spider-Man 3* villain problem, to just completely glossing over Steve’s reentry into the world, this film just reeks of creative clashes between the director and producers, most of which probably happened after filming and not before, resulting in a script that could have done with about six more drafts, and a film that feels like its had its guts ripped out in the edit.

  
####Nomadland ★★★★½
Dec 26th

This film has a really natural feeling that I love. From its performances to its cutting, every beat flows and feels like the natural passage of time, telling a very sweet story of this melancholic, and courageously stoic character.

  
####The Painter and the Thief ★★★★½
Dec 26th

One of the most fascinating stories I’ve ever seen, told in an equally fascinating manner. I was so invested in the characters that I was quite sad when it ended and I didn’t get to see how far their story went.

***

And that’s it! Thank you so much for reading if you made it through all that!

Only realised while writing this up how many homegrown films and documentaries I saw this year. 9 NZ films and 8 docos, which I am very proud of. 10 foreign language films too. Excited to increase these numbers next year!🤞

On the bright side, there will at least be some award-winning puns/memes to come out of this. Looks like the trailer backlash was warranted after all.

It was the last nail in the coffin for me in terms of my hope that M. Night Shamylam could have a rebound after his fall from grace. The plot (im being liberal with the use of the word plot) was garbage, the idea was garbage, the execution was garbage and M. Night casts himself as a prophet in it. Aside from a few moments of unintentional comedy, it had no redeeming qualities. I got my money back for it despite having sat through all of it. The guy at the counter didnt even ask follow up questions, he was so used to doing it for that movie im guessing.

1007,52g657,"There should be a movie starring Vin Diesel and Terry Crews where they (and their group) play D&D together, but it actually acts out the campaign, switching between the table and the setting, a-la ""The Princess Bride"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/52g657/there_should_be_a_movie_starring_vin_diesel_and/,"I've heard over and over that Vin Diesel and Terry Crews are big nerds who play D&D. I've even heard they play together. Mr. Diesel also seems to have a lot of input into his movies, even having directed a few video games himself. I think with those two in there, there is the making of a phenomenal movie that alternates between a group of friends playing D&D around a table that then has each of those actors playing their characters. Vin plays his character, Terry plays his, the others play their own. Whoever is DMing is also the narrator, and also plays all of the bad guys. 

It opens like it's an actual fantasy movie: Robert Downy Jr. (because that's who I picture in my head, I don't know if he's ever done anything like D&D) is narrating something about our heroes journey, describing them each and how they came together, and the camera pans over a fantasy village. In walks, in fantasy costume, Terry Crews, Vin Diesel, The Rock, Matt Damon, and Patton Oswalt. Patton could play the halfling bard (who wouldn't want to hear him sing?), Matt Damon plays an annoying min-maxing elf who takes too long to do the math and doesn't role-play enough (when his character speaks, he sounds ""out of place"", think when a character talks in ""Drunk History""), and The Rock could be ""the new guy"" (playing an ironically physically weak wizard) at the table to guide the viewer through some of the basics. His charater is still jacked, but he can't do something simple like push a small boulder or lift a tiny wooden cart because his strength stat is 8. 

At the end of the introduction, Terry Crews objects to the description of what he is wearing. It cuts to a big table at one of their houses, everyone sitting around with their character sheets, the board in the middle has their pieces on a graph sheet. Dice everywhere. RDJ has his secret divider set up and the rule-book out in front of them, and they argue about their starting equipment for a minute. RDJ finally caves and it cuts back to the characters, and Terry's character is wearing the ""correct"" armor now. 

I would love to see that. The fantasy parts would be taken seriously like it's an acted out D&D campaign, but it also has the realistic out-of-character relationships and discussions that make up a really important part of any campaign with friends. Plus, I want to see Terry Crews roll a dice, get a perfect 20 and get really excited and start yelling, then cut to Crews in full body armor swinging a broadsword and chopping off an ogre's head in one blow and still yelling, then cutting back to Crews IRL again standing up, yelling, then looking around awkwardly and realizing he got too excited. 

Every villian would be the DM (RDJ again I think just fits, he's just smug and arrogant but also friendly enough), the Ogre is a CGI RDJ, the thief in the hood is him, the big bad monster at the end has his voice. And of course, he's also the narrator. It has comedic potential, it has flashy action and CGI, it has big-name actors doing something ironically nerdy but somehow believable. I think it would make money, what with Hollywoods insistence on making a movie adaptation of everything, but I don't see a D&D movie ever working without acknowledging that it's all still ""pretend"" on some level. Everyone knows D&D, and I read recently that its use in ""Stranger Things"" has led to an increase in sales of D&D stuff lately, so the timing is perfect, too!",41378.0,1886.0,1473708544.0,,The Princess Switch: Switched Again

In the first, a little girl wishes to a male fairy godmother that her father get a part on Broadway. In the second, an evil witch locks up all the fairy godmothers in order to take over. The connection between these two plots is that the witch needs just one more wand for her plan to be complete and that wand belongs to the male fairy godmother.

I had only seen the Nostalgia Critic review of it before. In stark contrast to her winning performance in ***Matilda***, Mara Wilson's acting here is quite poor and unemotional but there is a good reason for that. Her mother had passed away the previous year and the loss affected her dedication towards acting. Martin Short is miscast as Murray, a male fairy godmother and neither his one-liners nor his slapstick work.

In fact the plot development as well as the comedy itself are both very random. The wish itself is very simple but Murray's clumsiness complicate things which is only an excuse for padding the story. There is one pointless interlude where they are both teleported to Nebraska. This is possibly a homage to ***The Wizard of Oz***, with Wilson exclaiming, ""Something tells me we are not in Manhattan anymore."" Except that it is not funny. Then Murray tries to turn someone into a ""little rabbit"" but his spell turns that man into a ""giant rabbi"" instead. Most of the film's humour is on this weak level.

The film's only inspired moments are in the other plot starring Kathleen Turner as the villainess Claudia and Amanda Plummer as her sidekick Boots. Boots is in fact a dog whom the witch has turned into a human and Plummer is fabulous with all the doglike tics and yips. Turner knows about the weak script and hams it up in order to breathe some life into her part and I liked it.

* **A Man Called Otto** \- The whole movie I felt like I was watching Up. . .But if the opening scene were extended, and the rest of the movie were set in the real world. It's a dark movie that is somehow super heartwarming.
* **Missing -**  Last year two of my top movies were ""X"", and ""The Menu,"" I'm just a huge fan of horror and/or thriller movies that try to do something totally out of the ordinary and appreciate the risks that went into making this one - Afterwards I found out this was sort of a sequel to a similar movie, ""Searching,"" which I now need to go see.
* **Air** \- I have no skin in the Air-Jordan game and don't even really particularly like basketball, but I felt this was a solid viewing experience and regardless of what was true and what was made up, it was just fun to watch.

# I Enjoyed it and Would Watch Again

* **80 For Brady** \- I'm not a football fan but when my wife and I first saw this trailer we knew we had to see it. 80 For Brady subverts the trope that all elderly romp movies tend to fall into \[>! we can only have fun because one of us is on our death bed!< \], while also recognizing that it's a ""thing"" that movies do. It was short, to the point, and silly. Added bonus - We realized at the end that this was the Super Bowl game from a few years back where we left the part late in the 3rd quarter ""knowing"" who the winner would be, only to get home and be like ""wtf happened.""
* **Cocaine Bear -**  I expected a B level silly slapstick horror movie - Something like Snakes on a Plane. I was surprised by the quality of the movie itself, and just how funny it actually was.
* **Scream VI** \- The ""reboot"" was a pretty good movie, but I really enjoyed this one too. Granted, I was able to pinpoint the main antagonist pretty early on, I don't think this took away from the viewing experience. Scream VI did a great job of pushing the narrative in certain ways to make me second guess my ""killer"" at multiple points in the movie - So while I ""knew,"" I also was never exactly sure.
* **Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves:** Still traumatized from the last attempt to at a D&D movie I went in with incredibly low expectations. Pleasantly surprised to find out it was actually a really good movie, and my wife who normally hates all this mystical bull crap really enjoyed it too. There's a scene I wont ruin that involves a cemetery, I just wish the trailers didn't spoil that for us, because it was just a beautiful setup.
* **Super Mario Brothers -**  I didn't know if I'd be able to get over the Chris Pratt voice \[I don't particularly hate him, but I do think it wasn't the right voice\], but the movie just does such a great job of hitting all of the nostalgia points, while also building a narrative that adults wont completely loathe, that I completely forgot all about it. Honestly, I'd like to see this high or something.
* **No Hard Feelings -** We found it to be hilarious in its absurdity and I can definitely see myself throwing it on again in the background. A lot of the laughs were definitely cheap, but it just worked for me.
* **Barbie -** I'm writing this blurb on December 27th. At this point I think I've seen the movie 4 times. It's just fun and silly, and makes poignant comparisons to life without overtly vilifying people. Though, I do think Will Ferrell's character felt largely pointless and underutilized and just reminded me of ""oh hey look The Lego Movie Again. . .""

# Enjoyed far More Than I Expected

* **M3gan** \- It's not a cinematic masterpiece and I really didn't expect much from the trailer. M3gan is very on the nose, but it's also unapologetic and fun to watch. Essentially, it knows exactly what it is, and leans into that premise exactly as much as it should.
* **House Party** \- I enjoyed it, but I also feel like a lot of the jokes that ""fell flat"" just weren't designed for me. House Party reminded me of the time I saw a Waynes Brother's \[don't remember which one\] comedy special live and realized it wasn't that the jokes weren't funny. . I just wasn't the target audience. Still, overall it was a funny movie.
* **Asteroid City -** After seeing the movie my wife and I realized that this was actually our first Wes Anderson movie, which is pretty crazy considering his career. If I had one critique of the whole experience, however, the ""Act Title Cards"" came so often that I felt like it took me out of the experience, and treated me like I was too dumb to remember that the whole thing was a play.
* **Oppenheimer -** This just isn't my type of movie. . .To quote the Groundhogs Day Musical, ""as a rule I think movies should be 10 minutes shorter,"" but I really enjoyed it. I know some people want this to be in the top of the year, and I recognize for other people it probably will be, but for me even though I didn't hate myself for 3 hours, it still did feel longer than I wanted it to be. . .Even though I couldn't think of a single minute that could reasonably be cut. My wife loved it, and loves these types of movies.
* **Gran Turismo -** Although I am a gamer and into some of gaming culture, I've never been into racing games and only vaguely remember the real story behind the movie happening. I didn't really expect to enjoy the movie, but came out very surprised.
* **Dumb Money -** I really had absolutely no hope at all for this movie to be good, and went out of obligation to a movement that I wasn't a part of, but do know many people that participated in. I liked it a lot, and just didn't expect to at all.
* **Killers of the Flower Moon -** Another movie that on my own I probably wouldn't have seen. It did feel incredibly long \[and I did end up taking 2 bathroom breaks and I think even a 10 minute nap\], but aside from that I did really enjoy the movie.
* **Thanksgiving -** I was largely expecting to see Violent Night, but Thanksgiving, and found this to be the much better of the two movies. . .Which based on google reviews is the opposite of how most people felt.
* **Godzilla Minus One -** Its been a very long time since I've seen a proper monster movie like this, and reminded me a lot of watching the old Godzilla movies on TV with my dad. Given the string of largely bad American made films in recent years, my expectations were low.
* **Anyone But You -** It looked funny and cheap. . It felt funny and cheap, but honestly it worked for me overall, and I wouldn't be mad if I had to watch it again.

# Enjoyed it, but Probably Wouldn't Watch Again

* **The Whale** \- I think I saw this more out of morbid curiosity of what Brendan Frasier was getting himself up to these days. I enjoyed the movie for what it was and left feeling terribly sad. Not typically the type of thing I'd go see, but I'd recommend it.
* **Devotion -** I got exactly what I expected out of this movie, but if I had a hankering to watch something like this again I'd probably just watch Top Gun: Maverick. The ending felt anti-climatic, but given that this is based on a true story I understand why things played out the way that they did.
* **Whitney Houston: I Want to Dance:** Not something I'd normally want to see on its own save for two things; 1) A great surge of really solid biopics in the recent present, 2) My father passed away 1 year ago and Whitney Houston was his favorite. Overall I did really like the movie, but felt like the movie was primarily fluff, only addressing Houston's drug problems on a surface level, and probably only because they felt it was well known enough that they had to. With drugs being a central theme of a lot of artists' biopics, it felt a bit disingenuous to me.
* **A Knock at the Cabin -**  I enjoyed it for what it was, and haven't read the source material \[which I've heard is a huge divergence\], but felt like there were a few plot holes in the overall premise that brought it down a bit \[>! It really felt dumb to me that each of the 4 dying was what brought on the next ""plague,"" though none of the 4 could explain what was stoping themselved from just not dying!< \]. The journey was enjoyable to watch, but I don't need to see it again.
* **Shazam! Fury of the Gods -**  I know the movie didn't do too well at the box office, and it certainly had its problems \[which is why it's here, and not the next tier up\] but I thought it was cute and had plenty of laugh out loud moments. Given that that is what we came to expect from the original movie, I was perfectly content in the end.
* **John Wick: Chapter 4 -** I had never seen any John Wick movie up until this year; but we went into this having binged the first 3 in preparation. The first movie felt like almost the exact perfect length and never felt like a chore; the next 2 were pretty-ok. This is where I struggle with John Wick 4; I felt like the movie could be split into two completely different clicks, separated right after the action leaves Tokyo. Everything before that point felt like a a self-contained almost perfect narrative. Everything after just felt like ""more of the same thing,"" which is hard to justify with such a long run time.
* **Evil Dead Rise -** Army of Darkness was my first R rated film at like 5 years old, and it started a deep love for Evil Dead and B grade horror. I felt like Evil Dead Rise hit all the notes that an Evil Dead movie needs, but that it also lacked a lot of the fun that Bruce Campbell brings to the table.
* **Renfield -** It's peak Nicholas Cage, just as a vampire, but I don't think it was memorable enough to warrant a second watch.
* **Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse:** I think for many people its worth a rewatch, and is likely full of Easter eggs, but for me it felt long. Sure it was enjoyable, but I don't know if I'd ever feel the need to commit the time to it again.
* **Indiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny -** Quite honestly, the last time I saw an Indiana Jones movie was Crystal Skull in theaters, so my expectations were low, but it's definitely not something I'd feel the need to watch again.
* **Talk to Me -** It felt a little full of itself at times and convoluted, but at the very least it had an interesting premise.
* **Strays -** Very funny on a first viewing. I just don't think a lot of it will land a second time around.
* **Five Nights at Freddy's -** I've never played one of these games, and really had no idea what to expect. It's clearly geared towards a younger audience \[to whom I understand love these games\] so I didn't really expect a ton of gore or a really complex story. I don't think it was amazing by any means, but I definitely got more than I anticipated out of it.
* **The Hunger Games: The Bllad of Songbirds and Snakes -** I didn't at all think it was an awful adaptation of the book, but I do think there was a lot of room for improvement. Its rare that I have a desire to see these types of movies more than once.
* **Ferrari** \- Didn't hate it, but it's also not my type of movie at all. I do feel we as viewers were thrown directly into the middle of something and left to figure it out on our own. I found myself on the drive home \[wife driving\] google the events of what happened to try to piece together a lot of the whole story.

# The Mediocre Movie I Expected it to be

* **Avatar: The Way of Water:** I know this one will make people unhappy, but the movie is just too damn long. And yes, I expected it to be too damn long, so I guess that's why it sits decidedly in the middle. This could have been a very tight, really strong, 2 hour movie \[I truly feel the entire first hour could be cut out and reedited as a 10 minute narrated prologue, starting the real movie when they meet the Water Clans\]. By the climax of the movie I found myself not really caring about what was going on anymore.
* **Plane -** There were a few missed opportunities and details in the movie that felt like they were placed to be utilized more \[like the found passports\], but overall Plane is exactly what I expected it to be. . .White House Down, but in the jungle.
* **Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3:**  I really enjoyed Vol 1 and 2, but with the recent string of not so great movies, I just didn't come into this expecting it to be on par. I think some people will disagree with me, but I think given the circumstance of Ant-Man, mediocre is a decent accomplishment.
* **Book Club: The Next Chapter:** We hadn't seen the original movie \[movies?\] but thought it looked fun. I'm not mad about it. . .It was certainly fun, but it also felt cheap and easy.
* **The Little Mermaid -** The only thing stopping this from going down a category is the fact that I've learned to not expect very much from these Disney remakes. My wife really loved it and says it's her favorite remake, I felt it lacked a lot of heart.
* **The Flash:** Can we all agree that the movie becomes an unintended Batman movie? I guess that's fine. . .But just give me a proper Batman movie that isn't almost 4 hours long and I'll be happy.
* **Joy Ride -** It was funny, but I feel like almost the entire thing felt cheap. I don't regret seeing it, but I do think that a second viewing wouldn't get more than a hearty chuckle from me.
* **Haunted Mansion -** I didn't hate it. . .It just sort of felt like something was missing.
* **Blue Beetle -** I think I mostly saw this because I like Cobra Kai and wanted to see something else with Xolo Maridueña. I didn't expect much, wasn't disappointed at all, but will likely forget all about it in a year or two.
* **The Creator -** I think this had a lot of potential to be a lot better, but it felt very long and became largely very predictable. Is being predictable a bad thing? I don't necessarily think so on its own, but the story felt largely openly derivative
* **Wonka -** In the first trailer for the movie Wonka says the key line, ""Scratch that, reverse it,"" which is iconic on its own. . And it just felt dry. This set the tone for my expectations of the movie. I don't think Chalamet did a bad job, and I do think he was right for the role, but I largely think that the movie misses the magic I wanted from it.

# Expected More and Left Disappointed

* **Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania:** I think I'm a simple guy. I don't read comic books, but really like Superhero movies. There are very few that Ive felt weren't at least a fun ride. The first 2 movies were great. This one just fell flat on all levels for me.
* **The Blackening -** I really wanted to love this movie, from the very first trailer. I felt as though it had a lot of heart in the beginning and was particularly very funny, but as we got into the third act my interest really fell apart.
* **Meg 2: The Trench -** The only thing stopping this from going down a category is just how bad I felt those movies were in comparison to this. I liked The Meg, I like Jason Statham, and I like cheap stupid premises. . .This movie should have been something I loved, but felt like Jumping the Shark. . .But like in reverse if that even makes sense?
* **My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 -** The first two movies felt way more cohesive, whereas this felt like little vignettes that short of worked together. I didn't hate it, but I was really hoping it would capture more of the magic of the first.
* **The Marvels -** There were a few fun scenes, but ultimately the movie is long, boring and forgetful.

# Worst of the Year

* **White Noise:** If it has Adam Driver I'm probably going to be dragged to see it whether I want to or not. That's not to say I don't like him or his movies, but this was definitely not on my radar at all. The dialogue felt like it should be part of a play, not a movie, and while I get what they were going for, I just don't think it was successful. My wife says it was a really great interpretation of the book that I didn't read, but my stance is that a movie adaptation should be able to stand on its own and shouldn't rely on enjoying the book in order to understand what the hell is going on.
* **Magic Mike's Last Dance:** I know and understand I'm not the target demographic, but in my defense, I did make my wife sit down and re-watch the first 2 with me so that I could at least appreciate the movie for what it's supposed to be. This movie seems like an attempt to legitimize Magic Mike as something more than a stripper movie. I saw a lot of potential it what the movie could have been, but felt it fell flat in literally every regard.
* **65**: This was just bad. I mean I expected it to be bad. I'm not surprised by the fact that it wasn't good at all - Just from the trailers I knew this was going to be a ""have a beer and take a nap,"" sort of feature, but my wife loves Adam Driver and so we went. I honestly can't think of much in terms of redeeming qualities, and wouldn't wish watching this on my first enemy.
* **A Haunting in Venice -** I felt torn on where to put this, because the truth is that I fell asleep 20 minutes in. . Woke up a half hour later, and fell back asleep. It's not unusual for me to take a 10 minute nap during a movie \[I work a lot\], but it says a lot when I just cannot make it through at all. My wife said she enjoyed it, but that it wasn't great.

&#x200B;

**Note:** At roughly $23/m for the AMC subscription that means I spent about $5/ticket to see each movie. My wife sometimes do buy concessions \[sometimes with points, sometimes without\], maybe next year I'll track that too, just to see how expensive a hobby this actually is.

[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/chaos-walking): 35/100 (14 critics)

As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie.

> Liman and editor Doc Crotzer keep things humming along efficiently enough, with a nudge from a big, muscular score by Marco Beltrami and Brandon Roberts. And in-demand action cinematographer Ben Seresin (he shot the upcoming Godzilla vs. Kong) takes advantage of the rolling green landscapes in terms of breadth and atmosphere. Maybe genre fans starved for large-scale sci-fi will find some appeal in the joyless journey. I couldn't get past the tiresome premise of men quite literally airing their insecurities.

-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chaos-walking-film-review)

> Flecked with a lesser version of the “last girl on Earth” urgency that made “Children of Men” so compelling, “Chaos Walking” most clearly hints at what could have been when it eschews typical YA tropes and embraces its secret identity as a weird and verdant neo-Western (the brunt of it was lensed in the lush forests north of Montreal). One mind-popping shot of Mikkelsen’s crew sweeping through the New World on horseback, their Noise trailing behind them like vapor trails, is all it takes to make you dizzy at the genre-mashing possibilities that were available to Liman here. And yet, this critic only has himself to blame for hoping that “Chaos Walking” might have deviated from the beaten path; original as it seemed on paper, what could better crystallize the spirit of modern studio filmmaking than a mega-budget movie about someone who’s mortally afraid of projecting a single provocative thought?

-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/2021/03/chaos-walking-review-1234620687/): C-

> Here, the execution is further confused by Holland’s animated body language and hyper-expressive face. When a director has that kind of charisma to work with, the Noise is just … well, noise.

-[Peter Debruge, Variety](https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/chaos-walking-review-1234920424/)


> There’s a stink of the YA-future-dystopia permeating “Chaos Walking,” and if the plan is to adapt the subsequent books in Ness’ series, here’s hoping any future installments go in a vastly different, substantive, and pointed direction. As it is, there’s no reason to visit this new world.

-[Alonso Duralde, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/chaos-walking-film-review-tom-holland-daisy-ridley/)

> Chaos Walking doesn’t do nearly enough to take advantage of its talented cast or the thematically ripe Noise which plagues the men of its world. Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley could have been a compelling duo, but they aren’t supported by a creative team that can get on the same page about what the focus of the movie should be. With its charms few and far between, Chaos Walking is a tough sell, especially considering the cast’s significantly increased clout in the years since it was first filmed means getting the gang back together for the implied sequel will be next to impossible. Fans of the novels may be better off waiting for the inevitable reboot. Maybe if you make enough Noise, HBO will pull a His Dark Materials and take another crack at it someday.

-[Tom Jorgensen, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/chaos-walking-review): 5.0 ""mediocre""

> While there are flashes of sympathy for those at the receiving end of manliness, Chaos Walking remains at its core a film about men and masculinity, toxic or otherwise. The film’s most imaginative ideas end up as little more than set dressing for a rather conventional story, as opposed to seeds that might have structured it in some radically new way. Beneath its perfectly entertaining surface, Chaos Walking is a mess of contradictions that fails to live up to its own potential.

-[William Repass, Slant](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review-chaos-walking-only-scratches-the-surface-of-its-fascinating-premise/): 2/4

> “Chaos Walking” has been in development for nearly a decade, with a number of prominent screenwriters reportedly taking a whack at a script over the years. Of course, it’s not all that unusual for a film, even some great films, to go through a long and winding process and many script iterations before finally going into production. Sometimes it all works out. Sometimes you get “Chaos Walking.”

-[Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun Times](https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2021/3/3/22309336/chaos-walking-review-movie-tom-holland-daisy-ridley): 1.5/4

I went through the threads for trailer #1, #2 and #3 and the Official Discussion and I saw zero hatred of JLaw in any of these threads. Keep in mind this is pre 'The Fappening' so this is kinda proof that the hatred of her started after that event or the equal pay or the debunked Golden Globes fiasco. Not that all of it is because of that but they are certainly pretty big factors.

Here are the threads for reference:

https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1pgl3u/xmen_days_of_future_past_official_trailer_2014/

https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2185rd/xmen_days_of_future_past_trailer_2/

https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/235gxl/xmen_days_of_future_past_final_trailer/

https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/269nag/official_discussion_xmen_days_of_future_past/

So really, the claim that all the blind and venomous hatred was always there is now a loose claim and I went through every thread and found NO hatred of her and just people talking about DoFP, unlike yesterdays thread where it could've just have been named 'JLaw Hate Thread 25/4/16'. It's actually kinda funny that in the Apocalypse trailer thread, people were saying how horrible DoFP was because her but yet again, no one seemed to give a shit back when the film was actually released so it does seem like people are now just jumping on the bandwagon. It's more that the psychology of this place can be strange.

But what about the opposite? What films make the audience root against a character and then show us that they were right the whole time? 

Spoilers allowed, I'm just looking for something that fits this theme.

Edit: Would you guys agree with me that Mr. Nevercracker from Monster House counts? Yay or nay? 

Edit 2: Loving the discussion here guys, so many movies to watch now, thanks! I do have to say that I'm seeing some popular answers like Star Wars (Vader) and Megamind, however those don't really fit what I'm asking for. I said characters that ""were right the whole time"". Megamind wasn't right until the last 20 minutes and Vader spent a grand total of 90 seconds being right. ",7812.0,4908.0,1698780306.0,Discussion,The Bad Guys

1236,zzvg5y,I saw 270 movies in theaters in 2022. Here is my full ranking.,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/zzvg5y/i_saw_270_movies_in_theaters_in_2022_here_is_my/,"Every year since 2015, I've been going to the movie theater as much as possible, keeping track of every movie I see (along with ticket stubs, scores, some thoughts, etc). I went 5 times in 2015, 9 times in 2016, 146 times in 2017, 165 times in 2018, 193 times in 2019, 45 times in 2020, 86 times in 2021, and 273 times in 2022. I rarely go watch a movie more than once, but it happens a few times a year. I try to go 3-5 times per week, depending on what's coming out. I have 25 or so theaters within 15 miles so I get a solid selection every week, everything from big blockbusters to obscure, one-theater-only international releases. I'm not big into horror so many notable ones will be missing from my ranking (*Halloween Ends*, *Smile*, *Orphan: First Kill*, *Terrifier 2*, *Prey for the Devil*, *Jeepers Creepers Reborn*, etc). With A-list, festival memberships/passes, reward points, matinee screenings, Discount Tuesdays, etc, I'd guess it probably averages out to only about $6-$8 or so per movie. I go alone most of the time. 

I set a goal in January 2020 to go see 200 different movies in theaters that year (after doing 192 in 2019), but had to abandon that in mid-March (after 44 movies) and didn't go again for the next 13 months because of COVID, then slowly started going back in late-March 2021. This year was a bit like making up for lost time in 2020/2021.

After ever only having been to 1 ever before, I also went to 5 film festivals this year: Savannah Film Festival (15 movies in 3 days), Miami Film Festival (16 movies in 7 days), Outshine Film Festival (6 movies in 5 days), Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival (11 movies in 6 days), and the Gems Miami Film Festival (5 movies in 2 days). For most of the festival screenings, members of the cast/crew were present for the movie and Q&As. Some highlights were Ron Howard after *Thirteen Lives*, Eddie Redmayne after *The Good Nurse*, Kerry Condon after *The Banshees of Inisherin*, Dean-Fleischer Camp after *Marcel the Shell with Shoes On*, Jeremy Pope after *The Inspection*, Eric Appel after *Weird: The Al Yankovic Story*, Jared Harris after *The Ghost of Richard Harris*, and Michael Ward after *Empire of Light*.

I try to stay away from reviews/trailers/etc as much as possible before watching something, to go in as blindly as possible. My ranking/thoughts/scores are for fun, I am not a professional (or good) reviewer and this isn't meant to be taken super seriously. It's basically just an enjoyment ranking, based on a score I give to a movie right after watching it. It's not really meant to put movies against each other, and I don't have any sort of checklist/requirements/guideline for scores. I just like going to the movies and keeping score for fun. 

-------------------------------------------------------------

**The Worst Person in the World** - 10/10 - *I haven't been this blown away by a duo of lead performances since Marriage Story. I love the way it was structured like a book, with important chapters of her life. Anyone that is struggling (or has struggled) getting their life together in their 20s will be able to form a strong bond with this movie. It's full of heartwarming and relatable and beautiful moments but always casting a strong existential shadow. On a technical level, it's one of the best directed and edited movies of the year. The surreal (and dream/trip) scenes could feel out of place in most other movies, but they're woven in perfectly here. Absolutely perfect bittersweet ending and Waters of March was a great match to go with it. Catchy and stuck in my head for a while. The kind of movie that just makes you melt into your seat as the credits roll. My favorite movie of the year.*

**Aftersun** - 9/10

**Petite Maman** - 9/10

**Babylon** - 9/10 - *Voodoo Mama is the best original song of the year. Margot Robbie puts in the best performance of the year (with an amazing scene-stealing performance from PJ Byrne in the few minutes he's in it). 'For the love of Cinema' is basically its own genre now (especially this year with Empire of Light, The Fablemans, Last Film Show, etc) but this is the cream of the crop. Starts off at 120 MPH, doesn't let off the gas for an hour, then it slows down a bit (maybe too much...), only for it to take another batshit crazy turn. An amazing final scene. Damien Chazelle does not miss. The scene where Margot Robbie, Olivia Hamilton, and PJ Byrne try to make a scene work with the new sound coordinator is the most I've laughed in a while.*

**Top Gun: Maverick** - 9/10 - *The best action blockbuster in a while. I can't add anything that already hasn't been said a million times before.*

**All Quiet On the Western Front** - 9/10 - *Up there with Paths of Glory, Come and See, The Bridge with being one of the best anti-war movies of all time. It has some of the best production design for a war movie I've ever seen, really impressive stuff for a non-Hollywood production. Very brutal, very grounded.* 

**Licorice Pizza** - 9/10

**CODA** - 9/10 - *The movie equivalent of a hot bowl of soup on a cold day. Soul-warming stuff. Reading the premise, you'd expect something really cheesy/tearjerky, but this gets around that and earns a bunch of real tears.*

**Close** - 9/10 - *The bus scene was the single-most emotionally-impactful scene of the year. Heartbreaking tale of childhood innocence and the consequences of societal pressures.*

**The Banshees of Inisherin** - 9/10

**Triangle of Sadness** - 9/10 

**A Chiara** - 9/10 - *A really unique and great mob movie. It doesn't concentrate so much on the mobsters, but the effect a criminal-empire has on the family of the boss. You're put in the shoes of the daughther of a mobster, and seeing her navigate and come to acceptance with her dad's situation made for a really thrilling movie.*

**Marcel the Shell with Shoes On** - 9/10 - *You haven't lived until you're sitting a full theater of people laugh-crying about a tiny shell. I saw this in July, couldn't stop thinking about it, and went to see it again in October with the director (Dean Fleischer Camp) in attendance.*

**Arsenault and Sons** - 9/10 - *This was a reallllly good crime-thriller. It's about a French Canadian family that owns a regular small-town garage but  are also involved in illegal off-season hunting and meat distribution. A close-knit spider web of crime that quickly unravels and crumbles. It reminded me a lot of Animal Kingdom. Great score that helps build tension throughout, amazing acting all round, with a great payoff at the end. The best French-Canadian movie since the Cannes double-premiere of You're Sleeping Nicole and Mommy in 2014.*

**Weird: The Al Yankovic Story** - *9/10 -Seeing this in a huge, sold out, 1200-seat theater with a completely raucus and wild late-night crowd full of Weird Al fans was honestly the most fun experience I’ve ever had at the movies. Something I'd pay a lot to experience again. Hilarious, perfectly-outrageous, but with a good amount of heart thrown in. Score is maybe inflated a bit based on how many drinks I had beforehand. Happy that Roku financed it in the first place, but still a bummer this won’t get a theatrical release. I feel like it was strongly elevated by that.* 

**Stars at Noon** - 9/10 - *My only complaint is that it wrapped up so quickly. I wanted another hour. Claire Denis' best movie since 35 Shots of Rum. If someone asked me to suggest a movie that's flown completely under the radar this year, it'd be this one. It's full of great performances, geopolitical spy/thriller intrigue, and mystery.* 

**The Whale** - 9/10 - *Brendan Fraser is rightfully getting a lot of praise for this performance, but the whole cast deserves it. Hong Chau and Sadie Sink put in two of the best supporting performances of the year. Aronofsky's recent stuff might get too bogged down by religious allegory but this worked on many more levels.* 

**Novembre** - 9/10 - *A mix of Sicario and Zero Dark Thirty. An air-tight, real-life, crime-thriller that doesn't waste a single second and keeps your heart pounding throughout (especially that one raid scene near the end, holy shit).*

**Holy Spider** - 9/10

**The Ghost of Richard Harris** - 9/10 - *The best documentary of the year. A sweet and honest tribute by 3 sons for their legendary, complicated father. It doesn't shy away from the tough topics, and the interviews feel deeply-personal, more than most documentaries. It covers his faults and his greatness evenly, perfectly balanced. The Jim Sheridan segment is probably my all-time favorite documentary interview, totally honest and revalatory.*

**Red Rocket** - 8/10 - *Pound-for-pound the funniest movie of the year and the best comedy since Don't Look Up.*

**Avatar: The Way of Water** - 8/10

**EO** - 8/10 - *On one hand, it made me lose all hope in humanity. On the other hand, it fully restored it. A delicate balance, and a beautiful little puzzle of a movie, and maybe the best overall score of the year.*

**The Good Boss** - 8/10

**The Batman** - 8/10

**The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent** - 8/10

**Ramona** - 8/10 - *Lourdes González is completely mesmerizing in this. One of my favorite performances of the year. A sweet, breezy, and quirky comedy-drama. The color/melodrama of Almodovar, the walk-and-talk romance of Linklater, and the aesthetic of Noah Baumbach, but a beautifully-personal and cute story that makes it stand on its own.*   

**Gagarine** - 8/10 - *A beautiful and sad story of childhood imagination and loss. It's an extremely unique take on the coming-of-age/first love/early friendship genre. Super sweet. Lyna Khoudri is going to be huge, I think. Came out of nowhere and blew me away. George Washington is one of my favorite movies ever, and this reminded me a lot of that. There was something really comforting and innocent about it.*

**Olga** - 8/10 - *Jaw-dropping performance for a first-time actress. Maybe the best debut performance in a while. Intertwined real-life footage doesn't work most of the time, but it was perfect in this movie. Amazing sound design, lightning (in the gyms especially), and use of non-actors. Imaginative transitions. Some sports movies can make 'big competition climax' seem corny and fake, but this was the opposite, it was a perfectly shot climax, like an Olympics documentary or something. The current situation in Ukraine adds a whole new parallel/layer to this already-amazing movie.*

**Thirteen Lives** - 8/10 - *Formulaic but very effective. A bit too long, but still a great rescue/survival movie. If this doesn’t win the Sound Design and/or Production Design Oscar, then I don’t know why those awards exist.* 

**Emily the Criminal** - 8/10

**Bodies Bodies Bodies** - 8/10 

**En Corps** - 8/10 - *Beautifully choreographed and uplifting movie.*

**Knives Out: Glass Onion** - 8/10

**X** - 8/10

**Everything Everywhere All At Once** - 8/10

**Tar** - 8/10 - *I really wish this cut the last 10 minutes. For me, the perfect end point would have been when she's watching the old Leonard Bernstein VHS tape at her childhood home, but Cate Blanchett carries this to greatness.*

**Puss in Boots: The Last Wish** - 8/10 - *Animated movies aren't really my thing, but this was a really fun and cute movie.*

**A Hero** - 8/10

**Crimes of the Future** - 8/10

**Drunken Birds** - 8/10

**Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness** - 8/10 

**Spider-Man: No Way Home** - 8/10 - *A really fun time.*

**Official Competition** - 8/10 - *A biting, meta, and sharp satirical-comedy set in the world of filmmaking. Maybe Penélope Cruz's best-ever performance.* 

**Italian Studies** - 8/10 

**Happening** - 8/10 

**The Northman** - 8/10

**Huda's Salon** - 8/10 - *This came out of nowhere. A lot more brutal and graphic than I thought it would be.*

**Elvis** - 8/10 - *Tom Hanks was miscast (it should've been Bill Camp),but I get that you need a big name in this. The first few minutes suck, but a fun ride after that.* 

**Nightmare Alley** - 8/10 

**Cha Cha Real Smooth** - 8/10 - *Sweet, lighthearted, unique, and refreshing rom-com. I need one of these once in a while.*

**The Menu** - 8/10

**Alcarras** - 8/10 - *I love a movie that just blindly throws you head-first into a complicated, layered, and relatable family drama. There's a rich built-in history that you can slowly piece together. The grandpa was amazing. All of the children felt like their own pillars to the story. A stern-but-loving dad clumsily trying to keep it together against a changing tide. Really great stuff.*

**Devotion** - 8/10

**Honk for Jesus. Save Your Soul** - 8/10 - *One of these days, Sterling K. Brown is going to get the recognition he deserves with a big award nomination (like he should've gotten for Waves a few years ago). This was really solid religious satire. It's like a behind-the-scenes version of The Eyes of Tammy Faye.*

**The Phantom of the Open** - 8/10 - *Liked this a lot more than I expected. ""If life is tea, she's my sugar"" is one of my favorite lines of the year. It does feel like Mark Rylance is always playing the same character though.*

**Black Panther: Wakanda Forever** - 8/10

**Fire of Love** - 8/10 

**Paris, 13th District** - 8/10 

**Brighton 4th** - 8/10

**Montana Story** - 8/10 - *Both comforting and unsettling. A really low-key family drama that sticks with you. Haley Lu Richardson is easily one of my favorite actresses, she's great in this.*

**The Fablemans** - 8/10

**Drive My Car** - 8/10

**Lost Illusions** - 8/10 - *A sprawling epic of early-1800s French publishing (as boring as that sound, it's really not, it's completely captivating and flies by) and a great story of ethics vs profits. I love that Xavier Dolan just randomly shows up in things.*

**The Lost King** - 8/10 - *Surprisingly sweet story about finding the body of King Richard III. Some of the comedy with the ex-husband character doesn’t land and feels really dated, but overall a solid modern biopic. I liked that they made King Richard a ghost-like character that followed her around, it might have been too generic of a biopic if they didn’t do something like that.* 

**Corsage** - 8/10 

**Blonde** - 8/10

**The Inspection** - 8/10

**She Said** - 8/10 -

**The Five Devils** - 8/10 - That karaoke scene though. 

**You Can Live Forever** - 8/10 - *This reminded me a lot of 2018's Disobedience (starring Rachel McAdams and Rachel Weisz), it's a story of forbidden lesbian love story set in a small-knit, religion-controlled community, led by 2 great lead performances. Really good drama with an amazing soundtrack. Plus, I'm a sucker for any Quebec-based films so this gets extra points.*

**One Fine Morning** - 8/10 - *It’s hard to explain but there's always a comforting warmth to Mia Hansen Love’s movies, and this was no exception. Heartbreaking and beautiful performance from Lea Seydoux.  Side note: Ending movies with a freeze frame is really corny and it never works, its a trend that should have stayed in the 80s or whereever.*

**Matilda: The Musical** - 8/10

**Sam Now** - 8/10 - *Very thoughtful documentary filmed over 25 years. 500+ hours of footage cut down to a journey of 86 minutes, about 2 half-brothers looking for the mother that abandoned them without explanation.*

**Nope** - 7/10 

**The Gray Man** - 7/10 - *Totally ridiculous, totally stupid, totally enjoyable. As far as Netflix's globe-trotting bloated action movies go (Red Notice, Six Underground), this is by far the best. I know that's not a high bar, but this had that '90s blank check action movie' vibe that just felt right.* 

**Hustle** - 7/10 - *A movie with this many non-actors will usually get distracting, but this pulled it off. A really solid sports-drama-comedy.* 

**The Woman King** - 7/10 

**Parallel Mothers** - 7/10 - *Well-built and well-acted like every Almodovar movie, but like All About My Mother and a few others, the melodrama chokes out the story and doesn't leave much room for any growth to the story. Penelope Cruz killed it as usual. Dollar Store Javier Bardem was pretty good too (it really did feel like Bardem wasn't available for the shoot so they got his doppelganger to replace him last-minute.)*

**Dog** - 7/10

**The Tender Bar** - 7/10 - *Ben Affleck just straight up stole the show. He was made for this supporting role and he'd get my vote at the Oscars. One of the sweeter (although a bit over-sentimental) movies of the year. You can just tell it was a book first. Mixed in with a great soundtrack, brought down a bit by Tye Sheridan.*

**Bullet Train** - 7/10

**Barbarian** - 7/10

**Plaza Catedral** - 7/10

**Hit the Road** - 7/10

**The Forgiven** - 7/10 - *It felt like a fully-loaded play with a million interesting characters. Great dialogue.*

**Thor: Love and Thunder** - 7/10

**See How They Run** - 7/10 - *If the universe was fair, we'd have a 10-film series of Sam Rockwell and Saiorse Ronan solving crimes together. It takes a usual whoddunit movie, then flips it, then flips it, then flips it again.* 

**Pearl** - 7/10

**Bones and All** - 7/10 - *I wanted to love this a lot more. Michae Stuhlbarg is wasted and I'm so tired of Mark Rylance playing the same exact character every movie. I get that he's widely-regarded as one of the greatest theater actors of his generation, but I find him very one-dimensional in film. This was a good movie, but I think it could've been a lot better.*

**Hold Me Tight** - 7/10 - *An amazing performance from Vicky Krieps, but it gets a bit too jumbled/confusing for me to give it a higher score. It felt like a puzzle missing a few pieces. Maybe that's the point. I don't know. The 2 intertwining realities kind of blend it together.*

**2nd Chance** - 7/10

**Three Thousand Years of Longing** - 7/10 - *George Miller swings for the fences, sometimes it lands, sometimes it crashes. This lands, and then crashes.*

**Coupez!** - 7/10 - *I went in thinking this was just a remake of the Japanese One Cut of the Dead, but was pleasantly surprised that it went another layer deep. If you want a horror-meta-comedy, this is it.*

**God's Country** - 7/10

**Maigret** - 7/10 -  *Decent, predictable, and mostly-forgettable crime procedural set in 1950s France, but does enough to keep you interested in the murder-mystery. You can figure it out pretty early on though.*

**Wild Men** - 7/10 

**DC League of Superpets** - 7/10

**The Box** - 7/10

**Compartment Number 6** - 7/10

**Ambulance** - 7/10 - *I know I'm supposed to hate this, but I just can't. I could list a million reasons why it sucks: The constant tonal changes (from a little girl literally being impaled by a fence to a few wise-ass jokes a minute later), so much product placement I felt like I was watching the Super Bowl, the sun being blasted into my eyeballs every 5 seconds (we get it Michael Bay, the sun exists), a super-weird marriage counseling scene, the awkward camera angles, etc. All that being said, it was just a whole lot of fun.* 

**To Leslie** - 7/10 - *Crippling alcoholism is a common theme at the movies this year. Andrea Risenborough and Marc Maron are awesome in this, but it's mostly something you've already seen before.* 

**Moonage Daydream** - 7/10 - *Was worth watching in IMAX (not often this can be said for a doc), but not my favorite documentary of the year. Memory of a Free Festival has been stuck on my playlist since watching this movie.*

**A Love Song** - 7/10

**Confess, Fletch** - 7/10	- *Jon Hamm awkwardly and confidently finds himself in the middle of an intercontinental murder-mystery. It's as fun as it sounds. Watch it.*

**Vengeance** - 7/10

**Nostalgia** - 7/10

**Amalgama** - 7/10

**Wet Sand** - 7/10

**Argentina, 1985** - 6/10 - *The tone was kind of weird, I went in expecting a fully-serious trial-drama (about post-dictatorship Argentina and the trial of the military leaders that ordered thousands of murders), but it ended up being played for a lot of laughs. Still a pretty good legal-drama though.*

**Clerks III** - 7/10

**Navalny** - 7/10

**Sundown** - 7/10 - *Lowkey, vague, slow, sun-drenched chiller that sticks with you.*

**Jockey** - 7/10 - 

**The Duke** - 7/10

**That Kind of Summer** - 7/10 - *Not many movies are this honest and open about sexual experiences.*

**18 1/2** - 7/10 - *Take a weird ass turn near the end but I enjoyed the bizzaro-alternate-history angle. Watergate told from a fictional personal point of view.*

**Watcher** - 7/10 - *Maika Monroe in a psychological-thriller, what more needs to be said?*

**Last Film Show** - 7/10

**Everything Went Fine** - 7/10 

**Scream** - 7/10

**Cyrano** - 7/10 - *Impressive set pieces & choreography and an amazing sound track (""Wherever I Fall"" is a song I find myself going back to a lot, same with ""Someone to Say""), but a like most of Joe Wright's work, it ends up a bit on the wrong side of bland. The great long-shot battle scene reminded of a lot of what he did during the famous beach beach in Atonement. Bonus points for the full-on commitment from Peter Dinklage, Kelvin Harrison Jr, and Haley Bennett, you really felt it on screen. Pre-2020 I could see this movie having been a huge crowd-pleasing hit, like The Greatest Showman. Kind of a bummer it flopped so hard.*

**Violent Night** - 7/10

**Spoiler Alert** - 7/10

**Ali & Ava** - 7/10

**The Territory** - 7/10

**The Lost Daughter** - 7/10 

**Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom** - 7/10

**The Daughter** - 7/10 

**Soul of a Beast** - 7/10

**Vortex** - 6/10 - *Technically impressive, and Alex Lutz had a really amazing supporting performance, but there's only so much double-perspective aimless wandering I can take, and it turns out 2 hours and 29 minutes is past my limit. Dario Argento's terrible French was really distracting too, he was really struggling to get lines out, and not in the natural way you'd expect/want. If you're in the mood to have your heart and soul crushed by the horrors of old age and the degenerative brain diseases that await many of us, I'd highly suggest *The Father* or *Amour* over this movie. Hardcore Gaspar Noe fans will like it though, he has a unique way of getting under your skin, and he definitely digs here. I liked the maze-like/claustrophobic/cramped feel of the apartment though, that really elevated the whole thing. The shower scene and the gas scene really hit, liked those a lot.* 

**Pinocchio** - 6/10 

**Beast** - 6/10

**Decision to Leave** - 6/10 - *Muddled, confusing, weird tonal changes, but it did look great. The most disappointing movie of the year for me, especially considering The Handmaiden is one of my all-time favorites. Neither a good romantic story nor a crime-drama. It's kind of just stuck in between.*

**White Noise** - 6/10 - *9/10 first half, 3/10 second half. The train derailment in the movie kind of happened at the same time as the derailment of the movie itself. Neat.*

**Emergency** - 6/10 

**The Bob's Burgers Movie** - 6/10

**Uncharted** - 6/10

**The Quiet Girl** - 6/10 - *I had really high expectations for this going in. It was one of the year's biggest indie hits in the UK & Ireland and it was a festival darling all across the globe. I thought it ended up being....just fine? It's a pretty generic story, an unwanted/overlooked child gets sent away to distant relatives in the country and they bond over shared trauma/sadness. It was well-shot and well-acted, but I was mostly left disappointed.*

**Saint Omer** - 6/10

**Armageddon Time** - 6/10 - *Anne Hathaway and Anthony Hopkins made this worth watching. Everything else, not so much.*

**The 355** - 6/10 - *An okay, generic, time-wasting action-thriller, with every plot twist you'd expect and a few good one-liners and world-travelling set-pieces (think *Triple Frontier*, or a Jason Statham/Liam Neeson vehicle with better cinematography).

**Brian and Charles** - 6/10 - *An extremely British Lars and the Real Girl.*

**A Taste of Hunger** - 6/10

**Lightyear** - 6/10

**Jackass Forever** - 6/10

**Death on the Nile** - 6/10 - *The fun thing about a murder-mystery is that deaths carry a lot of weight. Killing off half of the characters really destroys that weight and removes any sort of investment I had in the movie. A fun script and good acting kept this afloat.* 

**Moonfall** - 6/10 - *Watching Armageddon, The Core, and The Day After Tomorrow 500x times each as a kid will always keep a soft-spot in my heart for movies like this.* 

**The Outfit** - 6/10

**The Greatest Beer Run Ever** - 6/10

**Empire of Light** - 6/10 - *It looked gorgeous and sounded amazing, but overall feels like a huge wasted opportunity. There's an amazing movie in there somewhere, as a tribute to cinema and theaters while following the cast of misfits keeping a theater alive on the south English coast, but it gets buried by a terribly-boring (and kinda creepy) main relationship, an overly-hammy performance by Olivia Colman, and way too many side-stories.* 

**The Drop** - 6/10 - *Painfully, absurdly, and wonderfully awkward but at the end of the day, it's a bit too stretched thin. Like an SNL sketch that goes on too long.*

**Ride Above** - 6/10 - *It relies too much on being emotionally-manipulative (quadriplegic girl teams up with autistic farmhand to train horses at a failing family ranch, I mean, come on), but the racing scenes and acting keep this interesting enough.*

**The Estate** - 6/10

**Dual** - 6/10 - *Riley Stearns's previous movie, The Art of Self Defense, was one of my favorite dark-comedies of recent years. I liked the premise, and I liked the alcoholism parralel, but I couldn't get past the terrible casting of the two leads (Karen Gillan/Aaron Paul).*

**The Bad Guys** - 6/10

**Downton Abbey: A New Age** - 6/10 - *I've never seen a single episode of the show, but I've seen both movies. It didn't quite have the cozy feeling of the first one, but it was still charming and overly-extravagant enough to be enjoyable. Points lost for many cliché plotlines.* 

**The Good House** - 6/10

**On the Come Up** - 6/10 - *Very clunky in the middle and about 30 minutes too long, but the rap battle scenes make this a worthy watch, especially the last one.*

**Eiffel** - 6/10

**Confessions of a Hitman** - 6/10 - *My dream movie or television project is a big-budgeted, sprawling retelling of the Quebec Biker War, but I guess this will do for now.*

**Catherine Called Birdy** - 6/10

**Immersion** - 6/10

**Emancipation** - 6/10 - *If it wasn't for the worst color-grading I've ever seen in a major motion picture, the worst accent work of 2022, and a ridiculous hand-to-hand alligator vs Will Smith battle, this would've been pretty good.* 

**Three Minutes: A Lengthening** - 6/10 - *It's an interesting choice, making a full-length documentary movie from a 3-minute clip of a pre-WW2 town, but I think it was stretched too thin.*

**Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore** - 6/10

**All of the Old Knives** - 6/10 - *Not great, but I liked the 'old-school-and-overcomplicated-spy-movies-they-dont-make-anymore' vibe this had going on. It really is a throwback to 1990s camp.*

**My Name Is Sara** - 6/10

**Master** - 6/10

**Don't Worry, Darling** - 6/10

**Men** - 6/10 - *I absolutely loved Ex Machina. I absolutely hated Annihilation. This is somewhere in the middle. Alex Garland has been very 'style over substance' for me in his past 2 features. Jessie Buckley was great as always though.*

**Where the Crawdads Sing** - 6/10 

**Till** - 6/10 - *In a vacuum, Danielle Deadwyler's courtroom scene is probably the most well-acted and captivating single moment I've seen on the big screen this year, and it deservedly should get her an Oscar nomination, but the movie as a whole wasn't as great as it should have been.*

**Call Jane** - 6/10

**Luck** - 6/10 

**Corner Office** - 6/10 - *In some moments, it's a really funny/relatable satire of workplace dynamics and the total absurdity of office culture, but most of the time, it's just too dry and slow to work. Really close to greatness though. I do love the variety of Jon Hamm's projects recently though.* 

**Nocebo** - 6/10

**Nanny** - 6/10 

**Christmas Bloody Christmas** - 6/10 - *The first 70 minutes were good and the 2 mains had great/fun chemistry, getting drunk and discussing movies/music while people get brutally murdered around them. Then the last 15 minutes really dragged, really stretching for runtime there. Loved the physical media references throughout (Vinegar Syndrome, Severin, etc.).*

**Firebird** - 6/10 

**Moon Man** - 6/10 

**Amsterdam** - 5/10 - *Kind of a mess, but Christian Bale makes it watchable. John David Washington on the other hand puts in one of the worst performances of the year.*

**Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths** - 5/10 - *Some of the best editing and set design of the year. The rest did not work.*

**Sin La Habana** - 5/10

**Jurassic World Dominion** - 5/10 - *If Top Gun: Maverick is the perfect blockbuster, this is the blandest blockbuster. Too many characters you don't care about, too many stupid decisions, too many side-plots. It's passable but I'll never watch it again. Let this franchise rest for a while.*

**American Dreamer** - 5/10 - *Peter Dinklage and slapstick comedy can only carry this so far.*

**You Won't Be Alone** - 5/10 - *If Terrence Malick directed a folk-horror. Sounds amazing, but didn't do anything for me.*

**Minions: Rise of Gru** - 5/10

**Benediction** - 5/10 

**Fall** - 5/10

**Belle** - 5/10 

**Mr Malcolm's List** - 5/10 

**Spirited** - 5/10 

**Passing** - 5/10 - *It was slow, but fine, until the ending blows the whole thing up. God that was bad. That should have stayed in the novel, it didn't translate to the screen at all.*

**Strawberry Mansion** - 5/10 

**Mrs Harris Goes to Paris** - 5/10 

**Arlette** - 5/10 - *Basically a French Canadian Veep, but not nearly as biting or funny, except for a few moments. I can appreciate the fact that a movie mocking the government is partially funded by the government, especially in a movie about supporting culture and the arts, but the ending mostly deflates that goodwill.* 

**Memories of My Father** - 5/10 - *The most dragged-out, melodramatic death scene you've ever seen in your life.* 

**Plan A** - 5/10 

**So Damn Easy Going** - 5/10

**Ticket to Paradise** - 5/10 - *Super-safe, super-sanitized, super-predictable, but I am happy that movies like this are still getting made and are bringing people to the theaters. I also wish more movies did blooper reels during the credits like this did, that's always fun.*

**The Automat** - 5/10 - *If it hadn't turned into a glorified Starbucks ad in the middle, this might've been pretty good.*

**Maixabel** - 5/10 

**Estacion Catorce** - 5/10

**The Tale of King Crab** - 5/10

**The Lost City** - 5/10 - *Tracy Buttstuff.*

**Sonic 2** - 5/10

**The Contractor** - 5/10 - *15 years ago, this would have been a huge, $150M-budgeted, franchise-starting, summer blockbuster starring Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. Now, it's a lifeless and confusing action movie pretending to have political intrigue. I'm surprised it didn't also co-star John Travolta.*

**Mothering Sunday** - 5/10 - *If you like naked people walking around aimlessly, this is the movie for you.*

**Bros** - 5/10

**The Cow Who Sang A Song Into the Future** - 5/10 - *It bites off more than it can chew. It tries to tackle so many issues at once but can't* 

**Apples** - 5/10

**Breaking** - 5/10 - *John Boyega doing his best 'Denzel Washington in John Q' impression. Some scenes are so over-acted (especially with the bank manager), that they become accidentally-funny.*

**Les Tricheurs** - 5/10

**Black Adam** - 5/10

**Loving Highsmith** - 5/10

**Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile** - 5/10 - *If only this could have lived up to the wonderful & lively opening dance/singing sequence between Javier Bardem and Lyle. It all goes downhill from there. Honestly, take out the stupid family (terrible casting all-around there, especially the kid) and cliché bad-neighbor, and increase the Bardem/Lyle scenes by 300%, and you've got something great.* 

**Utama** - 5/10 - *I get it. A family's way of life is dying and a stubborn, aging patriarch is bringing dragging them down with it. It's got great, sprawling landscape shots and feels very grounded, but I was just so bored.*

**Father Stu** - 5/10

**Strange World** - 5/10 

**Ahed's Knee** - 5/10 - *I feel like I don't know enough about middle-eastern geopolitical issues for this to work for me, much like the director's previous movie (Synonyms).*

**Memory** - 5/10 - *As far as ""im too old for this shit' Liam Neeson action movies this year go, this is miles ahead of Blacklight (see: bottom of this), but that's not a high bar.*

**Unidentified Objects** - 5/10

**The Good Nurse** - 4/10 - *Drab, generic crime story that lacks any tension or suspense. Chastain was good, Redmayne was terrible.* 

**The Eternal Daughter** - 4/10 - *Watching a Joanna Hogg movie is like accidentally and awkwardly walking into someone else's therapy session, or it's like the feeling of waking up and instantly forgetting an insanely-vivid dream. It's uncomfortable.*

**Frank and Penelope** - 4/10 - *Could be good if you're in the mood for a pulpy, cheap, late-night, Tarantino-ripoff crime movie, but it wasn't for me.*

**Flee** - 4/10

**A Journal for Jordan** - 4/10

**You Resemble Me** - 4/10 - *Watch November instead.* 

**American Underdog** - 4/10 - *Could've been alright with more football and less sentimental-cheesy romance/religious stuff.*

**Infinite Storm** - 4/10 - *I'm really burnt-out on survival-dramas. I had trouble staying awake during this one.*

**Morbius** - 4/10

**Attachment** - 4/10

**Salvatore: The Shoemaker of Dreams** - 4/10 - *Once in a while, really talented people get together for a bunch of fast money and make an extended commercial that's not worthy of their talent.*

**The Silent Twins** - 4/10

**Summering** - 4/10

**Jane** - 4/10

**My Donkey, My Lover, and I** - 4/10 - *Totally corny and painfully unfunny. Watch Wild instead, if you're in the mood for a 'middle aged woman goes hiking to discover herself' movie. Cool donkey though, points for that. Wine moms probably love this movie.*

**Aline** - 4/10 

**Wildhood** - 4/10 - *There is not a single original bone in this body. The acting was atrocious.*

**Waiting for Bojangles** - 4/10

**Paws of Fury** - 4/10 - *The story behind the production of this movie is far more interesting than anything the movie itself offers.*

**Delia's Gone** - 4/10 - *I thought Diane Keaton in Mack & Rita would run away with the honor, but Marissa Tomei in this movie easily puts in one of the worst performances I've ever seen on the big screen. It was like a bad parody of Matthew McConaughey in True Detective. Stephan James is picking really bad projects post-*Beale Street*.*

**Jane by Charlotte** - 4/10 - *If a lame Mother's Day card was made into a movie. The anti-Ghost of Richard Harris. Awkward and clunky.*

**Studio 666** - 4/10

**I Am Here** - 4/10

**Detectives vs Sleuths** - 4/10 - *One of the most convoluted, nonsensical crime movies I've ever seen (I've seen The Snowman and nothing is ever topping that). A total mess from start to finish. Could not keep track of any character or motivation or ""case number"".*

**The Invitation** - 3/10 - *I remember watching this in 2019 when it was named Ready or Not and didn't suck. I've never seen a vampire movie so afraid of an R rating. Laugh-out-loud stupid ending that should have been cut.*

**My Policeman** - 3/10 - *Boring. Really came close to falling asleep a few times. Extremely sedated romantic-drama. I'd rather there was no ""future"" version of the characters, just the originals. Maybe that would've made it better.*

**Leonor Will Never Die** - 3/10 - *Too meta. Too quirky. I felt like I was on the outside of an inside joke the whole time.*

**Last Flight Home** - 3/10 - *There's something overly-sanitized, overly-edited, fake, control-heavy, and gross about this documentary. Just didn't feel right. At its core, its the story of a dysfunctional family milking their father's assisted suicide for their own needs. A sad, lonely man watching politics on TV in his final days, reminiscing about the good old days and reaching for death, while his family films it.*

**Rifkin's Festival** - 3/10 - *Wallace Shawn was so awful in this. Woody Allen has some classics, but this is rock-bottom.*

**Marry Me** - 3/10

**The King's Daughter** - 3/10 - *I don't think anybody else saw this in theaters. I remember Pierce Brosnan's hair, that's it.*

**Both Sides of the Blade** - 3/10 - *I'm a huge fan of Claire Denis, but some of her more recent movies have left me more irritated than anything else. If you want to watch 2 hours of an annoying couple just bicker at each other for no reason, I guess you might enjoy this. I hated all 3 main characters. I didn't care about what happened at all. Worst love triangle ever.*

**The Rose Maker** - 3/10

**Mack & Rita** - 3/10 - *""She's so old every second counts"" was the only redeeming line or memorable moment. It felt like a movie that was supposed to come out 20 years ago. Freaky Friday, but creepy.*

**Firestarter** - 3/10

**Easter Sunday** - 3/10 - *Awkward, unfunny, cheap-looking.* 

**Medieval** - 2/10 - *Some of the all-time funniest/awful line-dubbing by Michael Caine in this. Maybe the worst-edited movie I've ever seen. The story is impossible to follow.*

**Hatching** - 2/10

**Three Headed Beast** - 2/10 - *What should have been an experimental 10-minute short is stretched out to an extremely thin and taxing 85 minutes. A boring relationship-drama about extremely unlikeable and annoying characters.*

**Matrix Resurrections** - 2/10

**The Railway Children Return** - 2/10 - *From the poster you'd think this was just a cheesy, bland, forgettable British period drama. It turns out you'd be right.*

**Enys Men** - 2/10 - *Every folk horror cliché messily jumbled together into a bundle of total nonsense along with purposefully out of synch audio and bad visuals. 90 minutes of pure cinematic torture.*

**Please Baby Please** - 2/10 - *I wonder how they got Demi Moore to be in this. I feel like that's an interesting story.*

**Simple Passion** - 2/10 - *The ""French people having lots of sex"" genre hits rock bottom here. It's like if a Lifetime movie accidentally got approved for an NC-17 rating.*

**Like Me** - 1/10 - *A boring & annoying & explicit soap opera masquerading as a full-length feature film.*

**Blacklight** - 1/10 - Possibly the worst ""action"" film I've ever watched. This was ""post-2000 Steven Seagal Action Movie"" bad. Embarrassing for all involved.

I'm not sure if this is going to be an unpopular opinion but this was the freshest take I've seen about career vs family life for women. It didn't get preachy about any of the decisions made. The ""you're okay"" at the end summed up what this movie was about. I went into this movie thinking it would go into how happy she would be had she had a family instead of working on her career (or vice versa) but it wasn't that at all. I also liked that she didn't end up with the same guy in n both scenarios. Your fate doesn't need to be a specific person.

Yes yes it was written by DB Weiss (we get it you don't like Season 8) but this movie is funny, has heartwarming moments, and most importantly... it rocks.

There are some pretty amazing cameos and anyone who is actually a fan of metal music will love the soundtrack while metal elitists will probably get pissed. They play all the big names like Metallica and Black Sabbath but also slip in shit like Zeal & Ardor. Tom Morello being a producer definitely helps. 

Overall it was a great little coming of age movie centered around metal music that I think most metal fans and even those who aren't will find some fun in. Check it out.",349.0,345.0,1649433953.0,Discussion,Metal Lords

INSIDIOUS: THE RED DOOR in theaters July 7 - Patrick & James

Patrick Wilson here (u/InsidiousMovie). You may know me as Josh Lambert from the INSIDIOUS franchise, and I also starred in Aquaman and the Conjuring films. Yes, all of these were directed by James Wan. I DO work with others...just not as often.  I'm making my directorial debut in INSIDIOUS: THE RED DOOR, in which I also star.

And producer James Wan here – Founder/CEO of Atomic Monster, co-creator of INSIDIOUS and SAW franchises, THE CONJURING Universe, producer of M3GAN, director of AQUAMAN and FURIOUS 7 (among others!). Looking forward to your questions!
